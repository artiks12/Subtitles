1	I can't let him go in alone.
2	It's too late.
3	By now, he's already there.
4	Then we follow.
5	Kofun, Wren and I can catch up to him.
6	Even if he does kill Sibeth,
7	how does he think he's gonna get out?
8	– We have to go.
9	– Yes.
10	No.
11	We have the entire population
12	of Pennsa inside this tunnel,
13	and we are nowhere near its end yet.
14	If she starts
15	hurling her God Thunder again,
16	this place may very well
17	become a mass grave.
18	There was a time to fight,
19	and that time has passed.
20	But my father is fighting.
21	Well, let's hope he's doing it
22	very quietly then.
23	No, thank you.
24	More for me.
25	So, do we have an actual plan?
26	Find the queen and kill her.
27	That's more of a goal than a plan.
28	You're gonna frighten people with that.
29	People are already frightened of me.
30	– But not you.
31	– Well, don't take it personally.
32	I just don't fear people
33	the way others do.
34	Why is that?
35	No. In fact, I was the runt of the litter.
36	But I was smarter than everyone else.
37	Smart enough to know
38	there were other paths to power.
39	Edo Voss was a giant of a man,
40	but because of that, he thought too small.
41	He wanted to use the sighted
42	to guide his armies.
43	He didn't even think about the fact
44	that they could read the books
45	of our ancestors.
46	Unlock knowledge
47	that could change the face of warfare.
48	I spent my entire life searching
49	for a power
50	that didn't come from how hard
51	you could swing your sword.
52	And now here I am,
53	sitting across from you.
54	Able to destroy entire cities
55	without an army.
56	That's something Edo
57	never even dreamed of.
58	Which reminds me.
59	It seems to me we should have heard
60	from Maghra by now.
61	At what point do we assume
62	that she's made other plans?
63	Maghra decides nothing quickly.
64	No doubt her family is trying
65	to convince her to fight.
66	But her twisted sense
67	of virtue will not be able to resist
68	the idea of sacrificing her own life
69	for her people.
70	Tormada.
71	Yes.
72	Have your bombs ready, just in case.
73	They always are, my queen.
74	It should be me facing her, not him.
75	Your sacrifice would earn us nothing
76	and leave your people without a queen.
77	So, I must surrender my husband?
78	If that's what comes with it. Yes.
79	Maghra. Stay the course. Stay the course.
80	This moment right here
81	may very well be
82	the moment for which you were born.
83	This is her tent. I can smell her.
84	Then where is she?
85	– My queen.
86	– You called for me.
87	Ayura, tell her what you hear.
88	Nothing.
89	Nothing?
90	No voices. No tools.
91	No sizzle of pans or fires in the pits.
92	No babies crying.
93	Just the muffled sounds of many feet.
94	Muffled?
95	Muffled by earth.
96	They're underground.
97	Hiding.
98	No. They're walking.
99	A tunnel.
100	They found a way out.
101	I do, my queen.
102	Bomb them.
103	– Kill them!
104	– Fire!
105	Fire!
106	Oh, no.
107	Fuck.
108	Come.
109	– She knows.
110	– Yes.
111	Keep moving!
112	I said keep moving!
113	Anything?
114	No.
115	Don't stop.
116	Fire!
117	Call it out!
118	– Ready!
119	– Ready!
120	Fire!
121	Stop!
122	– Kofun?
123	– Wait here.
124	Kofun.
125	We have stopped them.
126	Excellent.
127	Hit them again.
128	Kofun?
129	Yeah?
130	Run! Run!
131	Kofun!
132	Kofun!
133	You, uh, think anybody heard that, Baba?
134	– Who's there?
135	– Captain?
136	They're between us!
137	– New plan?
138	– New plan.
139	Fight!
140	Kofun!
141	You all right?
142	I'm okay. Nothing's broke.
143	– Are you sure?
144	– Is Wolffe okay?
145	We can't go any further.
146	– We can't stay here.
147	– We'll be buried alive.
148	If it's come down
149	to choosing our manner of death,
150	I'd rather die fighting for our land
151	than hiding beneath it.
152	I agree.
153	I agree.
154	Me too.
155	– General.
156	– What is it?
157	– Fighting. Within the camp.
158	– Witchfinders?
159	Not Witchfinders and not Trivantians.
160	Two men. One of them is very large.
161	Baba Voss.
162	They've infiltrated the camp.
163	Sound the alarm! Intruders in the camp!
164	Intruders in the camp!
165	Intruders in the camp!
166	Intruders! Intruders in the camp!
167	They have been through here. Let's go.
168	Baba, you dead?
169	No.
170	– Me neither.
171	– Head for the bombs.
172	Maghra.
173	– Why would she come now?
174	– Stop the attack.
175	She hasn't abided with your terms.
176	My sister is as simple
177	as she is predictable.
178	Now she will sacrifice herself
179	to save what's left of them.
180	We should continue the attack.
181	They still have an army.
182	And in a matter of moments,
183	it will be our army to command.
184	– How can you trust that...
185	– Tormada.
186	You've come inside me,
187	and you've bombed a city into submission.
188	I'd say you're having a good day.
189	Don't ruin it.
190	Halt!
191	Lieutenant Moss!
192	Every spare soldier should be searching
193	the camp for intruders!
194	Yes, sir.
195	You heard him. Fan out.
196	Maghra.
197	I'm just sorry that it's come to this.
198	Are you?
199	I know you think I'm wrong,
200	but, just like you,
201	I'm only trying
202	to do what I feel is right.
203	By killing innocent citizens?
204	Don't you ever get tired
205	of your own self-righteousness?
206	– I protected you.
207	– You betrayed me.
208	That was to protect everyone else.
209	And round and round we go.
210	Sibeth.
211	Let me remind you that you tried
212	to overthrow me when you were younger.
213	And now you tried again.
214	And in both cases,
215	the dire consequences
216	of your insurrections
217	I wonder what it will take for you
218	to understand that you are not,
219	and never will be a queen.
220	I never wanted to be queen.
221	I don't think either
222	of us really believes that.
223	You needed to have everything
224	that was mine.
225	Oh, this isn't about us.
226	– It's not?
227	– Sibeth.
228	We can fix this.
229	There is still a chance
230	for everyone to get what they want.
231	I already have what I want.
232	You won't kill me.
233	You might hate me,
234	but I know you still love me.
235	You're still the sister
236	I have loved my whole life.
237	Who braided my hair.
238	Who made puppets for me.
239	Who brought me into her bed
240	when it thundered.
241	My sister.
242	Who sung me to sleep
243	the night Mother died.
244	Never losing patience.
245	Never once letting go of my hand.
246	I know. I know.
247	Is it done, my queen?
248	Kill her.
249	– Maghra!
250	– Tamacti.
251	Formation!
252	Ready! And!
253	– Well, you wanted a fight.
254	– That I did.
255	– Kofun!
256	– Here.
257	Move!
258	Resume the attack!
259	Fire those bombs!
260	Flatten the fucking city!
261	Tormada.
262	– Tormada!
263	– Baba Voss!
264	I was hoping I'd run into you.
265	Dad!
266	Stop them!
267	Baba Voss! Are you still with us?
268	– I won't make the same mistake twice.
269	– Tormada!
270	How are you hurt?
271	I am fine.
272	Do not follow me.
273	– Where are you going?
274	– To end this.
275	Papa, you cannot go.
276	You are too badly hurt.
277	Do not follow me.
278	I will stay with you.
279	No. I need you to stay here.
280	I need you to protect me
281	with your arrows like you always have.
282	Look at me. I love you.
283	Maghra.
284	Baba.
285	I see you.
286	Dad!
287	I walk now, every morning,
288	past the shops and the homes.
289	I can hear the families inside...
290	Talking. Sleeping.
291	Laughing. Crying.
292	When I listen to them,
293	I feel like a mother who wakes up at night
294	to make sure her baby is still breathing.
295	I know I'm not really outside
296	to hear them.
297	It's you I am seeking.
298	Some last echo of you still bouncing
299	between the mountains.
300	You have left behind a vast emptiness
301	that wakes me up every morning
302	and forces me outside.
303	You never wanted any of this.
304	I know that.
305	And every day,
306	I think about what was taken from you.
307	What I took from you...
308	in the service of this crown
309	I'm not even sure I deserve.
310	Your children feel your absence
311	every bit as much as I do.
312	But their futures,
313	the ones you gave your life to ensure,
314	stretch out before them
315	with infinite promise.
316	Your daughter has followed
317	in her mother's footsteps
318	and married a Trivantian.
319	Two sighted women making their way
320	in this world.
321	It won't be easy, and I fear for them.
322	But I hear the love in their voices
323	when they speak.
324	Kofun is coming into his own as a father.
325	And I know having a son means
326	not a day will go by
327	that he doesn't think of his own father.
328	I find myself drawn
329	to this terrible place...
330	whose charred soil holds the remains
331	of both my sister and my husband.
332	And I wonder how anything
333	will ever grow again in this burned,
334	ruined earth.
335	I don't know where we go when we die.
336	But wherever you are,
337	I hope you have finally found
338	the peace you tried so hard
339	to find in life.
340	For you and for all of us.
341	And I hope you can forgive me.
342	No one is denying
343	the debt we owe Paya
344	for defeating Tormada
345	and destroying his weapons.
346	I myself barely escaped his attack
347	on our own government.
348	However, we cannot sign this,
349	or any treaty,
350	with a nation that will allow sanctuary
351	to the sighted.
352	We've all just borne witness
353	to the destructive power of vision.
354	It is the position
355	of the Trivantian people
356	that vision simply poses too much
357	of a risk to all of us.
358	I understand your position.
359	But it was not vision
360	that built Tormada's bombs,
361	but Tormada's cruel exploitation
362	of sighted children
363	that accessed the knowledge
364	of the ancients.
365	And it is that destructive knowledge,
366	not vision itself,
367	that needs to be outlawed.
368	The sighted will always be the gateway
369	to this knowledge.
370	And there will always
371	be people like Tormada
372	who would choose to exploit them.
373	We stand with three sighted people,
374	all of whom have played a significant role
375	in defeating Tormada
376	– and destroying his bombs.
377	– Yes.
378	And as we said earlier,
379	we will grant them amnesty.
380	Why should we need amnesty?
381	We haven't done anything wrong.
382	Uh, in fact, i-if it weren't for us,
383	then Tormada and his bombs
384	would be destroying your city right now.
385	Haniwa, now is not the time.
386	– No? When is the right time?
387	– Princess!
388	I fear you have forgotten
389	who you're talking to.
390	I think it is you who has forgotten.
391	Ambassador, I apologize...
392	Vision is not coming back!
393	It's already here.
394	And if I were you,
395	I'd be grateful
396	that we are offering you peace,
397	because trust me,
398	you do not want us as an enemy.
399	– Was that a threat?
400	– Of course not...
401	Ambassador, I apologize.
402	You must understand,
403	my sister and I have been hunted
404	our entire lives
405	simply because of how we were born.
406	The idea that I
407	or anyone like me would be a threat
408	to the unsighted is based simply
409	on superstition and fear,
410	and not the reality of who I am.
411	Because who I am has nothing to do
412	with the fact that I can see.
413	I'm a son.
414	I'm a father.
415	I'm a Payan.
416	But most importantly,
417	I'm your partner in peace.
418	So, please. May we continue?
419	Very well.
420	Haniwa.
421	Tak.
422	Tak.
423	Did she accept?
424	They agreed to talk more about it
425	down the road.
426	But for now?
427	She has no choice.
428	She has to think of the kingdom.
429	We cannot afford another war.
430	She promised to protect us.
431	She has an entire kingdom to protect.
432	And as prince and princess, so do we.
433	You don't really think that you're going
434	to be king here, do you?
435	The people of Paya
436	would never allow a sighted king.
437	And even if they did,
438	the Trivantians wouldn't allow it.
439	You heard what they said there.
440	Forget being king or queen, Kofun.
441	They don't even want us to exist!
442	– Why are you so angry?
443	– Why are you not?
444	We will never belong here.
445	This isn't our world.
446	This is where my family is.
447	This is where I'll raise my son.
448	Your son will always live
449	in a different world than you.
450	My children will never forgive me.
451	You saved thousands of lives,
452	including theirs.
453	You formed the beginnings
454	of a true dialogue with Trivantes.
455	But vision is once again forbidden.
456	When I was young,
457	my father used to fish for salmon.
458	Every autumn,
459	he'd bring me down to the river,
460	and we'd fish.
461	For the first few days,
462	we'd usually catch nothing.
463	Then one day, we'd catch one.
464	Two.
465	Hardly enough for a household.
466	But enough to know
467	that the next day there'd be more.
468	Five salmon, ten salmon.
469	Soon the entire river
470	would be teeming with salmon.
471	Vision is coming back.
472	You and I have met
473	the first few fish swimming upstream.
474	More will come.
475	Some are, no doubt, already here.
476	Others will follow.
477	No law, no religion will stop it.
478	How we choose to handle it
479	within our borders is our business.
480	The Trivantians
481	made their position very clear.
482	Politicians following a script
483	they know nothing about.
484	The war over vision will be fought,
485	not between Paya and Trivantes,
486	but within cities.
487	Within families.
488	Within our own hearts.
489	Regardless, nature will have its way.
490	She always does.
491	Well...
492	you seem to have made
493	your own peace with it.
494	The single advantage
495	to being as horribly wrong
496	as I've been in my life
497	is that new ideas are easier to accept.
498	Smells like death.
499	I think Baba always knew
500	he would die in battle.
501	He told me once,
502	death must be earned
503	every bit as much as life.
504	With his last breath,
505	he defeated an entire army.
506	And by doing so, saved us all.
507	I think his death was well earned.
508	You sound a bit envious.
509	But while I'm still walking here
510	on this earth,
511	I'll do my best
512	to keep you out of trouble.
513	I would be lost without you, Tamacti.
514	How so very sad for both of us.
515	I miss him, Ranger.
516	Baba was a giant man,
517	so it makes sense
518	that there's a giant-sized hole
519	in the space he used to fill.
520	You know, Baba died for you.
521	For all of us.
522	But it's important
523	to remember not that he died for you,
524	but that he lived for you.
525	If he was here, that's what he would say.
526	I hear Lu has arrived.
527	Yes.
528	Yes, we head home tomorrow.
529	You're welcome to stay.
530	Thanks, um, but, uh, Lu and I,
531	we don't like crowds or people,
532	you know, crowds of people.
533	Well, I could give you a horse.
534	Haniwa!
535	Charlotte?
536	Haniwa!
537	Nah, I'm not back. Not for long anyway.
538	I just needed to make sure you were okay.
539	I'm so sorry to hear about Baba.
540	Then I heard that you
541	and Wren got married,
542	and I'm so happy about that.
543	And now I don't know if I should talk
544	about the sad thing first
545	and then the happy thing?
546	Or do it the other way,
547	or maybe you don't wanna talk
548	about it at all.
549	How did it go with the Compass?
550	How are Sheva and the kids?
551	Well, the little ones are great.
552	I don't think Sheva
553	likes me very much.
554	But I don't like her either,
555	so, you know, that'll work out.
556	She said you'd know what it means.
557	She wishes you a safe journey.
558	So... I take it you're going somewhere?
559	Will you come with us?
560	Not this time.
561	Who will keep me safe?
562	And she has you.
563	I am needed at the Compass.
564	Jerlamarel's children
565	will be keeping us busy and...
566	I get the feeling more will be coming.
567	They are lucky to have you.
568	You be careful out there.
569	You too.
570	Thank you.
571	It was my pleasure.
572	I'm not crying.
573	Will you come find me?
574	You come find me.
575	Are you sure
576	you don't want to say goodbye?
577	It wouldn't go well.
578	I'll see them again.
579	It's getting chilly.
580	Winter will be here soon.
581	It's been almost a year
582	and still no word from Haniwa.
583	It could be a while till we hear from her.
584	Do you ever think about the Alkenny?
585	Every day.
586	Just the four of us, always together.
587	I'm sure we were sometimes cold,
588	but in my memories it's always warm.
589	I thought when I became queen,
590	I would be able to give us that.
591	But once we set out
592	to find the Lavender road,
593	we were never going
594	to be that family again.
595	No.
596	But we are still a family.
597	You handle yourself well with the council.
598	You've earned their trust.
599	Maybe... you were born to do this.
600	Well, Haniwa says the kingdom
601	would never accept a sighted king.
602	What do you say?
603	I know what Dad would say. He would say,
604	I think my eyes have betrayed me.
605	And they will again.
606	What are you saying?
607	My father died trying
608	to save this kingdom.
609	If they weren't my people before,
610	they are now.
611	I can't fully serve the people or my son
612	if my sense
613	of the world is different from theirs.
614	I'm saying, I think I've seen enough.
615	I want to live in the same world
616	as my son.
617	I want to hear, feel, smell what he does.
618	Kofun.
619	There's no going back.
620	You'd have to be absolutely sure.
621	I'm sure.
622	You made it.
623	You know us?
624	No. Not yet anyway.
625	But I am so glad you found us.
626	As I'm sure you can imagine,
627	everyone here has been
628	on a journey very similar to your own.
629	I am Michaela. And you are?
