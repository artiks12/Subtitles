1-2	It took me a long time and some hard lessons
3-4	to learn what I know about love, fate, and chasing redemption.
5-5	But it started with a simple choice,
6-6	escape or die.
7-7	Back in here at one o'clock, you bludgers.
8-8	– Yeah, yeah.
9-9	– I know.
10-10	– Ooh, here he comes.
11-11	– Hello, doggy.
12-12	– You're in trouble now, mate.
13-13	– Dead man!
14-14	You're gonna get yours, dog.
15-15	You're a dead man.
16-16	They let Barnes out of the slot.
17-18	He's got friends in high places, hasn't he?
19-19	I'm not ready.
20-21	Dale, would you just forget about escaping?
22-23	Tell that bloody cop what he wants to know.
24-24	And then what? I'm not a dog, Ned.
25-26	Well, every fucking convict out there already thinks that you are.
27-28	Shit, Barnes, he almost killed you last time, didn't he?
29-30	What, you think he's just gonna not finish the job?
31-31	– Fuck it. I'm going now.
32-32	– You're what?
33-33	Dale! What about me?
34-34	You gotta take me with you.
35-35	Dale. Dale!
36-37	It's nearly one o'clock. It's never gonna work with these things.
38-38	Dale, we've gotta go back.
39-39	Dale, listen to me!
40-41	We can get back onto the wing before the next count.
42-42	There's a buzz saw downstairs.
43-43	– No. They'll know it was missing.
44-44	– Or they won't.
45-45	– It won't work.
46-46	– It will work.
47-48	Because they'd never think a convict would be stupid enough to use a power saw
49-49	to escape over the front wall.
50-51	And they'd be bloody well right. Fuck this, man. We have to go back.
52-52	Mate, I can't go back.
53-53	– Come on, come on.
54-54	– You four.
55-55	Fuck.
56-56	Stay tight. They can't see us from here.
57-57	Okay.
58-58	How high is it?
59-59	– Thirty, 40 feet, maybe.
60-60	– Uh-huh.
61-61	We could bloody break our legs.
62-62	– Move.
63-63	– Dale, I'm scared of heights.
64-64	You're gonna be fine, mate.
65-66	You know what? You go, all right? I'm gonna go back, but you go.
67-67	– For fuck's sake. Calm down.
68-68	– Just let me go. I can't fucking do this.
69-70	You can't go back. 'Cause then they're gonna know I'm gone.
71-71	– Yeah b...
72-72	– Hey, yeah. Mate, you're going first.
73-73	Fuck.
74-75	In that moment, I was waiting for the rifle shot.
76-76	I didn't dare think I might be free.
77-77	The cops been here?
78-78	No.
79-79	Where did you go before coming here?
80-80	I didn't.
81-81	Not to your mother?
82-82	That's the first place they'd be waiting.
83-83	I was the next person you thought of. Why?
84-84	I don't know.
85-86	I didn't give it much thought. I just jumped the wall and got away.
87-87	I didn't have much of a plan beyond that.
88-89	Well, I'm sure you have friends who can be much more use in your current situation.
90-90	Practically, I mean, to a fugitive.
91-91	You're not my student anymore, Dale.
92-93	And I'm not in the business of helping escaped convicts.
94-94	Sir, I had to escape.
95-96	They were gonna kill me in there. I really didn't have a choice.
97-97	Choice is all you have.
98-99	I mean, I can't go back to college. I can't be a paramedic.
100-100	There's not much left.
101-102	I was so proud... ...of getting out of where I came from,
103-103	of how proud my mum was...
104-104	proud of what you saw in me.
105-105	And now look at me.
106-106	I'm a failed student, a failed son...
107-107	You're better than all those things.
108-108	No.
109-109	No, I know what I did...
110-110	what I need to pay for.
111-112	Dying in prison wasn't gonna make it right.
113-114	You haven't escaped anything unless you go on to something, so...
115-115	what do you want to be?
116-117	I wanna be the man I was gonna be before all of this.
118-118	You can't. Not here. Not anymore.
119-119	Then I have to leave.
120-120	Why?
121-121	Because I know who you really are.
122-123	And I think you came here to have someone remind you of it.
124-124	No more guns, Dale.
125-125	No more armed robberies or heroin.
126-126	Don't you make me into a fool.
127-128	Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Bombay.
129-129	While opening the overhead compartments...
130-130	– Go. Go on.
131-131	– ...please take care.
132-132	The first thing I noticed was the smell.
133-134	In that first Bombay minute, I didn't recognize it.
135-135	But I do now. It was the smell of hope.
136-136	– Next.
137-137	– Ladies and gentlemen,
138-138	welcome to Bombay International Airport...
139-140	But standing there with another man's name and fake passport,
141-141	hope and fear felt much the same.
142-142	Good morning, sir!
143-143	I am number one guide in Bombay.
144-145	I know everything there is to know about my golden city.
146-147	You are in need of assistance? I can show you everything.
148-148	– Hey... Thank you, but no.
149-149	– Sir, let me assist you, sir.
150-150	Yes, sir.
151-152	But forgive me, sir, this was only a one-time no, huh?
153-154	And here in my India, a one-time no is not a true no.
155-155	Yeah? So what's a true no?
156-156	Only after three noes, it is a true no.
157-158	Please, sir, allow me to show you cheap, clean hotel.
159-159	And after, you decide what to pay.
160-160	What if I decide to pay nothing?
161-161	Then that is your choice, sir.
162-163	But I don't believe it's a choice you'll be making.
164-164	I am number one guide in Bombay.
165-166	Yes, sir. Very big, sir. Everyone agrees. You are knowing me too well.
167-167	– Ah, you want to see our merch?
168-168	– No.
169-169	Sir.
170-170	Myself, Prabhu.
171-171	Lindsay.
172-172	– Lin-see.
173-173	– Lindsay.
174-174	Lin-see. Sir, don't mind, huh?
175-176	But... ...this is a not-so-good name.
177-178	It is too long and squeaky for, uh, how Indian people speak.
179-179	– Okay.
180-180	– I think short name, short name.
181-181	– That's...
182-182	– “Lin” is better.
183-183	– Yeah, no problem.
184-184	– You do not object? I can call you Lin?
185-185	– Uh, Lin's fine.
186-186	– Very good.
187-187	Also, it has a very lucky meaning.
188-188	– Oh, yeah? What's that?
189-189	– “Great penis.”
190-190	Great penis?
191-192	It is not meaning this exactly, but it is sounding like ling,
193-193	and that is meaning, “great big penis.”
194-194	it is full power name, too lucky name.
195-196	Everyone will love this name when they hear it. You'll see.
197-197	Okay, you win.
198-198	Show me a hotel.
199-199	Sir, come, sir.
200-200	You like?
201-201	I like.
202-202	Where are you coming from?
203-203	New Zealand.
204-204	How's that working for you?
205-205	That why we're here, to debate philosophy?
206-207	What, you think you're too clever for me, do you, Dale?
208-208	I'm just a dumb policeman.
209-210	But years of experience has given me a philosophy
211-211	based on, uh, you know, empiric research
212-213	that, just like day follows night, every man succumbs to his nature,
214-214	even a smart boy like you.
215-215	You think your mother's proud?
216-217	I was watching her in the courtroom, blaming herself.
218-218	– Well, you broke her heart.
219-219	– Don't talk about her.
220-221	You know why you are worse than all the scumbags in here?
222-223	Because you had the chance to be different.
224-225	All the advantages she worked so hard to give you, and yet here you are.
226-226	And a good man is dead.
227-227	Who killed Officer Floris?
228-228	Give me the name.
229-229	Come on, mate.
230-230	I can't remember.
231-231	You will.
232-233	Wake up, Linbaba! I have so much to show you.
234-235	Should we take this white motherfucker the long way round?
236-236	Chai also.
237-237	– I pay?
238-238	– Mmm.
239-240	How long has this motherfucker been in town?
241-241	What is this “maderchod?”
242-242	Oh, “motherfucker.”
243-244	Very good curse, Linbaba. Everyone is using it.
245-245	Bloody hell!
246-246	Is he fucking mad?
247-247	And if we stop for lunch...
248-249	How much do you charge this white motherfucker?
250-250	Who are you calling “motherfucker?”
251-252	I was a wanted man with a price on my head,
253-253	on the run with no home and no country.
254-254	But for now, I was free.
255-255	Every day on the run is your whole life.
256-257	And there's hope and excitement in the new.
258-258	I don't really need any fabric.
259-260	You know, I'll come back maybe tomorrow. Tomorrow. Tomorrow.
261-261	You're lucky I was here.
262-262	Maybe you're my guardian angel.
263-263	There's too much devil in me for that.
264-264	– How much devil are we talking?
265-265	– Hey, Karla! Come on.
266-267	If you come to Reynaldo's sometime, maybe you'll get to find out.
268-268	Oh, Karla!
269-269	– Who is this?
270-270	– You made a new friend?
271-271	You found it then. I'm Karla Saaranen.
272-272	Lindsay Ford. People call me Lin.
273-273	They do?
274-275	Yeah, I'm aware of the whole “great penis” thing.
276-276	Just “penis,” no “great.”
277-278	Just means, you know, everyday, average, kind of...
279-279	All right.
280-281	Beware her riddles and her seductions, young man.
282-282	– Didier Levy.
283-283	– Lindsay Ford.
284-284	– Were you leaving?
285-285	– Yeah? Just got here.
286-286	Then why on earth are we standing?
287-287	Come. Join us.
288-288	You can stand to eat a meal if you must.
289-290	You can stand to make love if you're able, but it's impossible to stand and drink.
291-291	It's the act of a barbarian,
292-292	an animal at the watering hole.
293-293	...the same.
294-294	Reynaldo's was an unofficial free zone,
295-295	scrupulously ignored by the local police.
296-296	Didier was a permanent fixture,
297-298	putting together buyers and sellers of anything that could earn him a commission.
299-300	But strict rules apply to all the business conducted there.
301-302	Deals for drugs and contraband were openly transacted at the tables,
303-304	but these agreements could only be sealed on the pavement outside.
305-305	Hookers, dealers, gamblers and gangsters.
306-307	Men who might kill each other any day and knew it.
308-309	But, in Reynaldo's, no blood was ever spilt.
310-310	Dangerous man, that one. Rafiq.
311-311	He used to run a black market in books.
312-312	– Books?
313-313	– Passports.
314-315	Rafiq is bitter about losing his book business.
316-316	Men were killed.
317-317	– What about that guy?
318-318	– The victor.
319-319	Abdullah Taheri.
320-321	He works for Abdel Khader Khan, one of the great crime lords of the city.
322-322	Didier, you talk too much.
323-324	What, are you expecting many serious injuries here in Bombay,
325-325	huh, Linbaba?
326-326	Force of habit. I was an ambo back home.
327-327	– Ambo?
328-328	– I drove an ambulance.
329-329	Better w-we pretend you're a doctor.
330-331	We could be making so much money like this.
332-333	Many patients I could bring you for a small commission.
334-334	Better we don't mention it at all.
335-336	Very cool, these sunglasses. Like Amitabh in Trishul.
337-337	Don't do that.
338-338	It's style, boss.
339-339	Do you wanna swap?
340-341	But... In all honesty, these are cheap and not so good.
342-342	Do you want them or not?
343-343	Why you do this?
344-344	Because you're my mate.
345-345	– What?
346-346	– I walked here barefoot
347-347	'cause a guy came in my shoes.
348-349	He looked totally straight, then I went into the bathroom.
350-350	Oh, my God.
351-351	Ugh, Lisa.
352-352	– Mmm, poor darling.
353-353	– How do I wear them now?
354-354	Lisa was an old friend of Karla's.
355-356	Somehow sad and sexy as hell all at the same time.
357-357	Crazy people love me.
358-358	Have I told you to get fucked yet, Didier?
359-360	You should do an interview, Lisa. Anonymous, of course.
361-361	– Yes.
362-362	– People will be fascinated by your story.
363-364	They will be fascinated by the man who came in her shoes?
365-365	– Yeah.
366-366	– Who would read this, Kavvie?
367-367	Vikram Khanna was a Bollywood stuntman.
368-368	His sister Kavita was a journalist.
369-370	Smart and ambitious and eager to make her mark.
371-371	What brings you to Bombay, Lin?
372-372	Tell her nothing, Lin.
373-374	In Bombay, everyone's story is their own to keep,
375-375	which drives Kavvie crazy.
376-377	Wherever Lisa went, her pimps Maurizio and Modena
378-378	– were never far away.
379-379	– This is Lin. He's from New Zealand.
380-380	Lin, Maurizio and Modena.
381-381	Lin.
382-382	Means “prick” in Hindi, right?
383-383	It takes a prick to know one.
384-384	My grandmother was from Padova.
385-386	Any other languages we should know about, just to avoid further embarrassment?
387-388	I swear pretty good in Marathi and Hindi these days.
389-390	I can even speak fluent American if the occasion demands.
391-391	It's pretty good. Do some more.
392-392	Well, I'm not asking you to forgive me.
393-393	I'll never understand or forgive myself.
394-395	And if a bullet gets me, so help me, I'll laugh at myself for being an idiot.
396-397	But there's one thing I do know. That is that I love you, Scarlett.
398-398	Wow.
399-399	– Arre, do Clint Eastwood. Can you?
400-400	– Yeah. Yeah.
401-402	“Well, you gotta ask yourself one question.”
403-403	“Do I feel lucky?”
404-404	“Well, do you, punk?”
405-405	– What is...
406-406	– It's Dirty Harry.
407-408	Is that Clint? If it's not a Western, I'm not seeing it.
409-409	You should be an actor or something, Lin.
410-410	And we should have dinner sometime.
411-412	You can talk American to me all night. I'd like that.
413-413	Bye, bye, bye.
414-414	– Ciao, Maurizio.
415-415	– Ciao.
416-416	– Oh, nice, nice. Ciao, Maurizio.
417-417	– Bye.
418-418	– He didn't look happy, yaar.
419-419	– I think you embarrassed him.
420-421	Those first few weeks, I watched all of the seekers come and then leave,
422-422	heading for the “real India,”
423-424	seeking enlightenment and solitude and self-contemplation.
425-425	But I'd had my share of that forced on me.
426-426	Instead, Bombay felt exhilaratingly free,
427-427	a place where everyone started new.
428-428	And I responded to that with all my heart.
429-429	You should get out of Bombay, Lin.
430-431	This is the place they were thinking about when they invented the word “the pits.”
432-432	You should go to Varanasi or Rajasthan.
433-433	I don't know. I like it here.
434-435	And perhaps Bombay offers our Lin things he won't find anywhere else.
436-436	N'est-ce pas?
437-437	Give this to Karla for me?
438-439	Tell her I said not to worry. I'm a big girl.
440-440	– Ciao, Didier. Lin.
441-441	– Oh, Maurizio.
442-443	Andiamo. We don't want to keep Madame Zhou waiting, hmm?
444-444	What's that all about?
445-445	In matters of food, I am French.
446-446	In matters of love, I am Italian.
447-447	But in matters of business, I am Swiss,
448-449	strictly neutral, especially with other people's business.
450-450	And I advise you to be the same.
451-451	Now, if you'll excuse me,
452-453	I see a man who might be of great consequence to my fortunes.
454-454	Bonne chance, Lin.
455-455	– Something I said?
456-456	– No, he's just got business to attend to.
457-457	– Looked like your meeting went well?
458-458	– It did, actually. Very well.
459-460	You just missed Lisa. She gave me something for you.
461-461	Walk with me?
462-463	I like that you haven't asked what this is for.
464-464	None of my business.
465-465	Yet here you are. How come?
466-466	Lisa asked. I like her.
467-468	Well, Lisa would spend all her money on dope if I let her.
469-470	I told her she needs to save some in case she ever needs it.
471-471	I hold it for her.
472-472	– “Fuck you money.”
473-473	– Exactly.
474-474	She'll never use it.
475-476	Even more than the heroin, Lisa needs to feel looked after,
477-478	even if it's by men like Maurizio who get her into trouble.
479-479	Maybe she'll surprise you one day.
480-480	I doubt it. She is what she is.
481-481	You don't think people can change?
482-482	They have to want to.
483-483	I think life's like a crowded lifeboat.
484-485	Maybe you throw out your pride to stay afloat,
486-487	maybe your self-respect and your independence.
488-489	friends, everyone you used to know, and it's still not enough.
490-491	The boat is still sinking, and you're going down with it.
492-493	That's Lisa. She'll never get out of the boat.
494-494	You're a good listener.
495-496	That's dangerous because it's so hard to resist.
497-497	Being listened to...
498-498	Really listened to...
499-499	It's rare.
500-500	Makes a person feel special.
501-502	Okay, now you're taking this good-listener thing a little too far.
503-504	...for business interests from the West and here in Bombay.
505-506	And then I realized if I was the one making the deals happen,
507-507	why not make them happen myself.
508-509	Bombay is changing fast. There's a lot of money to be made here.
510-510	Is money what you want?
511-512	What I want is to be master of my own destiny.
513-513	Money gives you that freedom.
514-514	Have I disappointed you, Lin?
515-515	No. No, not at all.
516-517	I think freedom is all you can ask for, however you find it.
518-518	What does your freedom look like?
519-520	To be able to choose where to be, what to do...
521-521	with who.
522-522	Then I'm honored.
523-523	This is me.
524-524	I'm sorry to have kept you so late.
525-525	You should grab a taxi. I'll pay.
526-527	I'll walk. Good way to get to know the city.
528-529	Then thank you, for this and for walking with me.
530-530	I enjoyed it.
531-531	Yeah, me too.
532-532	Fuck.
533-533	– Come here.
534-534	– Hey!
535-535	Where are you going?
536-537	Nowhere. Just a tourist. I got a little bit turned around.
538-538	Hey, it's past curfew.
539-539	There's a curfew?
540-540	Show us your papers.
541-541	Show your passport.
542-542	Look, breaking curfew, very bad.
543-543	– I think you should go to jail.
544-544	– Ah, come...
545-545	Hey! Would you like to go to jail, gora?
546-546	No.
547-548	I think you would not like to go to jail at all, Mr...
549-549	Listen, I'm leaving Bombay.
550-550	It's time I moved on.
551-551	Where?
552-552	I don't know. Goa maybe? Varanasi?
553-553	– When?
554-554	– Tomorrow. This'll be our last day.
555-556	Yeah, yeah. These places all the goras are going to, I don't think you'll like.
557-557	– Can't stay here forever.
558-558	– No, I know this.
559-560	But you should go to a real Indian village, na?
561-561	Listen.
562-562	I'm listening.
563-564	If you are wanting, I could take some time from my schedule
565-565	and take you to my village.
566-567	I've never offered to take a gora before, but you are my good friend.
568-569	One train, two bus rides. It is beautiful there.
570-570	You'll come, na?
571-571	I would be honored.
572-573	And I will charge same as Bombay only, huh?
574-574	One hundred rupees a day.
575-576	Hey, very generous of you to offer, Lin. I accept.
577-577	– Who is it?
578-578	– Karla.
579-579	Laundry day?
580-580	Yep.
581-581	I'm leaving town.
582-582	Were you gonna say goodbye?
583-584	Yeah, I was gonna come by Reynaldo's tonight.
585-585	Come in.
586-586	These are quite something.
587-587	Yeah. Tough paper round.
588-588	What's going on?
589-590	I was hoping you'd maybe help me with something.
591-591	Okay.
592-592	Lisa's in a really bad situation.
593-594	Maurizio convinced her to work in a brothel called the Palace.
595-595	It isn't good. It caters for all tastes.
596-597	And Madame Zhou, the woman who runs the place, is pretty scary.
598-598	What about Maurizio?
599-600	Maurizio doesn't give a shit about anyone but himself.
601-602	Parker was coming with me to demand Lisa's release as an American citizen.
603-603	Sounds like a good plan.
604-604	It was, until Parker left town.
605-606	I can't stand the idea of Lisa being prisoner in that place.
607-608	And then I thought of you doing your accents the other day.
609-609	Lisa said you were pretty good.
610-611	And you thought I could pretend to be this guy?
612-612	Yeah.
613-613	I... Look, Karla, I'm sorry, but... I can't.
614-614	You could.
615-616	I mean, you're not just some tourist out to see the world, Lin,
617-617	or I wouldn't be here.
618-618	Maybe that's why I can't get involved.
619-620	Everyone here is running away from something.
621-622	Yeah, I know. And I plan to keep right on going.
623-624	It doesn't work. Trust me. You can be free of anything but yourself.
625-625	You don't know anything about me.
626-627	But I thought there was something worth knowing.
628-628	Guess I was wrong.
629-630	One way or another, you're gonna say the words.
631-631	So let's just get to it, huh?
632-632	Who pulled the trigger?
633-633	I'm not a dog.
634-634	I'm here to be punished for what I did.
635-636	No, no, no. Doesn't fucking work like that.
637-637	You don't get to feel better.
638-638	Punishment is punishment. Pain is pain.
639-640	This isn't a path to a better place, kid. Huh?
641-641	This is all you've got coming.
642-643	There's no redemption for the likes of you.
644-644	Don't you knock? Even just once?
645-646	We must go and collect our train tickets for tomorrow now.
647-647	This way, no last-minute problems.
648-649	Also, we must buy gifts for everyone in my village.
650-650	Everyone?
651-651	Help me! Help me!
652-652	– This is not our business, Lin.
653-653	– Let's go. Lin!
654-654	– Please. Help me.
655-655	– Let me see. Let me see.
656-656	– When was the last time he shot?
657-657	– He's dying!
658-658	– When was the last time?
659-659	– I don't know.
660-660	– Give me some room.
661-661	– Somebody call the police.
662-663	Lin, this is not our problem. It is very bad business.
664-664	– When did he last shoot?
665-665	– It is best we are not involved!
666-666	– Lin, let's go!
667-667	– An hour? I don't know.
668-668	Lin, the police are coming!
669-669	No! Come back! Come back!
670-670	You know, I could've saved him.
671-671	I've treated overdoses before.
672-672	Where are you taking him?
673-674	I don't know, Linbaba. He was looking pretty dead to me.
675-675	I could have fucking tried.
676-676	It's nothing to do with me.
677-677	– You have to come with us now.
678-678	– I don't wanna come with you.
679-679	What's the point, Prabhu,
680-681	being here, of any of it, if all I am is scared?
682-682	What is it that you are scared of, Lin?
683-683	I gotta do something.
684-685	Hey, Lin, we are leaving tomorrow early, yaar.
686-686	Look, go get the train tickets.
687-688	I'll be back here tomorrow. We'll leave as planned.
689-689	Right now, I gotta be somewhere.
690-690	– Who is it?
691-691	– It's me. Lin.
692-692	– I'll do it.
693-693	– What?
694-694	Lisa.
695-695	If we can go tonight, I'll do it.
696-697	Either way, I'm leaving Bombay first thing tomorrow morning.
698-698	What changed?
699-699	Come here.
700-700	Choose something smart.
701-701	You've got a lot of men's clothes.
702-703	The last two guys who lived here left suddenly.
704-704	And didn't take their gear?
705-706	One of them was breaking the law. He had to leave in a hurry.
707-707	I'll leave you to it.
708-708	Fits you well.
709-710	So what happened to the other guy who lived here?
711-711	He died.
712-713	Whose suit is this? The bad guy, or the dead guy?
714-715	I bought it for Ahmed to be buried in. In the end, we didn't use it.
716-716	Fuck me, Karla.
717-718	Don't tell me you're superstitious. A man like you?
719-719	What does that mean? A man like me?
720-720	I don't know. Isn't that the point?
721-721	Who do you report to?
722-723	Counselor for Political Affairs, Arlen Hayes.
724-724	Your hometown?
725-725	Donald... Donald Gable.
726-727	Rumor is, Zhou is the former mistress of a KGB officer.
728-729	But people say a lot of weird stuff about her.
730-731	Bottom line, she is smart, vindictive and dangerous.
732-733	Lisa wouldn't be the first girl to disappear from the Palace.
734-734	How do you know so much about her?
735-736	I get paid to make deals happen. Some of them happened here.
737-737	Fuck me.
738-738	Ram ram, Miss Karla.
739-739	Padma.
740-740	Sir, if you please, your business card.
741-741	Mr. Parker. Karla knows the way.
742-742	Ready?
743-743	Is this your American?
744-744	Gilbert Parker, with the American Embassy.
745-746	This is not an official visit. At least not this time, anyway.
747-747	– You are here doing a favor?
748-748	– Yes.
749-749	– For you.
750-750	– I don't think so.
751-751	Are you in love, Mr. Parker?
752-752	– What?
753-753	– I fear you are in love with our Karla.
754-755	Is that how she got you to do this little job of work for her?
756-757	I'm here because I was told an American citizen is being held against her will.
758-759	Don't think for a minute that Karla will ever love you in return.
760-761	I tell you this, Mr. Parker, as my favor to you.
762-762	Duly noted. Now, where's Lisa Carter?
763-763	Mmm. Lisa is where she is happy to be.
764-765	Well, then bring her out and let her tell me that herself.
766-766	I don't think so.
767-767	Let's go. This is a waste of time.
768-768	Your business is with me, not her.
769-770	You don't look or talk much like a diplomat.
771-771	No. No, I work out of the embassy.
772-772	Nobody said I was a diplomat.
773-774	My department tends to be a little more hands-on.
775-775	Parker.
776-776	So you should get me Lisa Carter.
777-778	Because if you fuck with me for one minute longer,
779-780	I will have agents camped on your doorstep,
781-782	taking photographs of anyone coming in or out.
783-784	And I'll make it clear to the authorities here in Bombay
785-786	that the Palace and the US government are now at war.
787-788	Quite the dog you bring in here on a leash, Karla.
789-789	Is this about Ahmed and Christina?
790-791	Nothing you do will change the fact they are gone.
792-793	If I walk out of here alone, there's no going back.
794-794	I agree to your terms, Mr. Parker.
795-795	You can take Lisa with you.
796-797	I just wonder if Karla will keep her end of whatever bargain you made.
798-798	She's really letting me go?
799-800	Mr. Parker here and Madame Zhou came to an agreement.
801-802	Then I guess I should be thanking Mr. Parker.
803-804	Let's get the fuck out of here before she changes her mind.
805-806	What the hell were you thinking, going after her like that?
807-807	I need a fix, Karla.
808-809	Zhou cut me off unless I told you I wanted to stay.
810-811	But I knew once you got my message, you'd come running.
812-812	Come here.
813-813	I'm ready.
814-814	I'll quit.
815-815	I just have to level off.
816-816	Give me the name.
817-817	Rujul.
818-818	The man I saw was Rujul Aadekar.
819-819	It's gonna be okay.
820-820	Wait!
821-821	Lin, stop! Come on!
822-822	Please.
823-824	Why? So you can feed me more bullshit about Madame Zhou
825-825	and whatever history you and her have got?
826-827	You know, I heard her say that dead guy's name, Ahmed,
828-828	the guy whose suit I was wearing.
829-829	– I didn't sign up to feed anyone's habit.
830-830	– There's more if you want it.
831-831	Fuck you.
832-832	You know, I heard Lisa in there.
833-834	You got her out so she could give you some name.
835-835	Wasn't to rescue her.
836-837	And I wonder what you're so guilty about that playing the hero was this important.
838-839	So this was all just some shit you fed me 'cause you knew I'd bite?
840-840	We all have secrets, Lin.
841-842	I don't wanna know yours because I have no intention of telling you mine.
843-844	But you're right. I got Lisa out for my own reasons.
845-845	But that doesn't change the good you did.
846-846	Don't confuse the two.
847-847	I hope you find what you need.
848-849	I felt like I'd been dropped straight into deep, dark water.
850-850	Everything exploding around me.
851-852	I am number one guide in Bombay. I know everything there is to know...
853-854	...touching everyone, friends and enemies...
855-855	changing everyone's lives forever.
