1-1	I can't let him go in alone.
2-3	It's too late. By now, he's already there.
4-5	Then we follow. Kofun, Wren and I can catch up to him.
6-7	Even if he does kill Sibeth, how does he think he's gonna get out?
8-8	– We have to go.
9-9	– Yes.
10-10	No.
11-12	We have the entire population of Pennsa inside this tunnel,
13-13	and we are nowhere near its end yet.
14-15	If she starts hurling her God Thunder again,
16-17	this place may very well become a mass grave.
18-19	There was a time to fight, and that time has passed.
20-20	But my father is fighting.
21-22	Well, let's hope he's doing it very quietly then.
23-23	No, thank you.
24-24	More for me.
25-25	So, do we have an actual plan?
26-26	Find the queen and kill her.
27-27	That's more of a goal than a plan.
28-28	You're gonna frighten people with that.
29-29	People are already frightened of me.
30-30	– But not you.
31-31	– Well, don't take it personally.
32-33	I just don't fear people the way others do.
34-34	Why is that?
35-35	No. In fact, I was the runt of the litter.
36-36	But I was smarter than everyone else.
37-38	Smart enough to know there were other paths to power.
39-39	Edo Voss was a giant of a man,
40-40	but because of that, he thought too small.
41-42	He wanted to use the sighted to guide his armies.
43-43	He didn't even think about the fact
44-45	that they could read the books of our ancestors.
46-47	Unlock knowledge that could change the face of warfare.
48-49	I spent my entire life searching for a power
50-51	that didn't come from how hard you could swing your sword.
52-53	And now here I am, sitting across from you.
54-55	Able to destroy entire cities without an army.
56-57	That's something Edo never even dreamed of.
58-58	Which reminds me.
59-60	It seems to me we should have heard from Maghra by now.
61-62	At what point do we assume that she's made other plans?
63-63	Maghra decides nothing quickly.
64-65	No doubt her family is trying to convince her to fight.
66-67	But her twisted sense of virtue will not be able to resist
68-69	the idea of sacrificing her own life for her people.
70-70	Tormada.
71-71	Yes.
72-72	Have your bombs ready, just in case.
73-73	They always are, my queen.
74-74	It should be me facing her, not him.
75-75	Your sacrifice would earn us nothing
76-76	and leave your people without a queen.
77-77	So, I must surrender my husband?
78-78	If that's what comes with it. Yes.
79-79	Maghra. Stay the course. Stay the course.
80-80	This moment right here
81-82	may very well be the moment for which you were born.
83-83	This is her tent. I can smell her.
84-84	Then where is she?
85-85	– My queen.
86-86	– You called for me.
87-87	Ayura, tell her what you hear.
88-88	Nothing.
89-89	Nothing?
90-90	No voices. No tools.
91-91	No sizzle of pans or fires in the pits.
92-92	No babies crying.
93-93	Just the muffled sounds of many feet.
94-94	Muffled?
95-95	Muffled by earth.
96-96	They're underground.
97-97	Hiding.
98-98	No. They're walking.
99-99	A tunnel.
100-100	They found a way out.
101-101	I do, my queen.
102-102	Bomb them.
103-103	– Kill them!
104-104	– Fire!
105-105	Fire!
106-106	Oh, no.
107-107	Fuck.
108-108	Come.
109-109	– She knows.
110-110	– Yes.
111-111	Keep moving!
112-112	I said keep moving!
113-113	Anything?
114-114	No.
115-115	Don't stop.
116-116	Fire!
117-117	Call it out!
118-118	– Ready!
119-119	– Ready!
120-120	Fire!
121-121	Stop!
122-122	– Kofun?
123-123	– Wait here.
124-124	Kofun.
125-125	We have stopped them.
126-126	Excellent.
127-127	Hit them again.
128-128	Kofun?
129-129	Yeah?
130-130	Run! Run!
131-131	Kofun!
132-132	Kofun!
133-133	You, uh, think anybody heard that, Baba?
134-134	– Who's there?
135-135	– Captain?
136-136	They're between us!
137-137	– New plan?
138-138	– New plan.
139-139	Fight!
140-140	Kofun!
141-141	You all right?
142-142	I'm okay. Nothing's broke.
143-143	– Are you sure?
144-144	– Is Wolffe okay?
145-145	We can't go any further.
146-146	– We can't stay here.
147-147	– We'll be buried alive.
148-149	If it's come down to choosing our manner of death,
150-151	I'd rather die fighting for our land than hiding beneath it.
152-152	I agree.
153-153	I agree.
154-154	Me too.
155-155	– General.
156-156	– What is it?
157-157	– Fighting. Within the camp.
158-158	– Witchfinders?
159-159	Not Witchfinders and not Trivantians.
160-160	Two men. One of them is very large.
161-161	Baba Voss.
162-162	They've infiltrated the camp.
163-163	Sound the alarm! Intruders in the camp!
164-165	Intruders in the camp! Intruders in the camp!
166-166	Intruders! Intruders in the camp!
167-167	They have been through here. Let's go.
168-168	Baba, you dead?
169-169	No.
170-170	– Me neither.
171-171	– Head for the bombs.
172-172	Maghra.
173-173	– Why would she come now?
174-174	– Stop the attack.
175-175	She hasn't abided with your terms.
176-177	My sister is as simple as she is predictable.
178-179	Now she will sacrifice herself to save what's left of them.
180-181	We should continue the attack. They still have an army.
182-183	And in a matter of moments, it will be our army to command.
184-184	– How can you trust that...
185-185	– Tormada.
186-187	You've come inside me, and you've bombed a city into submission.
188-189	I'd say you're having a good day. Don't ruin it.
190-190	Halt!
191-191	Lieutenant Moss!
192-193	Every spare soldier should be searching the camp for intruders!
194-194	Yes, sir.
195-195	You heard him. Fan out.
196-196	Maghra.
197-197	I'm just sorry that it's come to this.
198-198	Are you?
199-200	I know you think I'm wrong, but, just like you,
201-202	I'm only trying to do what I feel is right.
203-203	By killing innocent citizens?
204-205	Don't you ever get tired of your own self-righteousness?
206-206	– I protected you.
207-207	– You betrayed me.
208-208	That was to protect everyone else.
209-209	And round and round we go.
210-210	Sibeth.
211-212	Let me remind you that you tried to overthrow me when you were younger.
213-213	And now you tried again.
214-214	And in both cases,
215-216	the dire consequences of your insurrections
217-218	I wonder what it will take for you to understand that you are not,
219-219	and never will be a queen.
220-220	I never wanted to be queen.
221-222	I don't think either of us really believes that.
223-224	You needed to have everything that was mine.
225-225	Oh, this isn't about us.
226-226	– It's not?
227-227	– Sibeth.
228-228	We can fix this.
229-230	There is still a chance for everyone to get what they want.
231-231	I already have what I want.
232-232	You won't kill me.
233-234	You might hate me, but I know you still love me.
235-236	You're still the sister I have loved my whole life.
237-237	Who braided my hair.
238-238	Who made puppets for me.
239-240	Who brought me into her bed when it thundered.
241-241	My sister.
242-243	Who sung me to sleep the night Mother died.
244-244	Never losing patience.
245-245	Never once letting go of my hand.
246-246	I know. I know.
247-247	Is it done, my queen?
248-248	Kill her.
249-249	– Maghra!
250-250	– Tamacti.
251-251	Formation!
252-252	Ready! And!
253-253	– Well, you wanted a fight.
254-254	– That I did.
255-255	– Kofun!
256-256	– Here.
257-257	Move!
258-258	Resume the attack!
259-260	Fire those bombs! Flatten the fucking city!
261-261	Tormada.
262-262	– Tormada!
263-263	– Baba Voss!
264-264	I was hoping I'd run into you.
265-265	Dad!
266-266	Stop them!
267-267	Baba Voss! Are you still with us?
268-268	– I won't make the same mistake twice.
269-269	– Tormada!
270-270	How are you hurt?
271-271	I am fine.
272-272	Do not follow me.
273-273	– Where are you going?
274-274	– To end this.
275-276	Papa, you cannot go. You are too badly hurt.
277-277	Do not follow me.
278-278	I will stay with you.
279-279	No. I need you to stay here.
280-281	I need you to protect me with your arrows like you always have.
282-282	Look at me. I love you.
283-283	Maghra.
284-284	Baba.
285-285	I see you.
286-286	Dad!
287-288	I walk now, every morning, past the shops and the homes.
289-289	I can hear the families inside...
290-290	Talking. Sleeping.
291-291	Laughing. Crying.
292-292	When I listen to them,
293-294	I feel like a mother who wakes up at night to make sure her baby is still breathing.
295-296	I know I'm not really outside to hear them.
297-297	It's you I am seeking.
298-299	Some last echo of you still bouncing between the mountains.
300-300	You have left behind a vast emptiness
301-302	that wakes me up every morning and forces me outside.
303-303	You never wanted any of this.
304-304	I know that.
305-306	And every day, I think about what was taken from you.
307-307	What I took from you...
308-309	in the service of this crown I'm not even sure I deserve.
310-311	Your children feel your absence every bit as much as I do.
312-313	But their futures, the ones you gave your life to ensure,
314-315	stretch out before them with infinite promise.
316-317	Your daughter has followed in her mother's footsteps
318-318	and married a Trivantian.
319-320	Two sighted women making their way in this world.
321-321	It won't be easy, and I fear for them.
322-323	But I hear the love in their voices when they speak.
324-324	Kofun is coming into his own as a father.
325-326	And I know having a son means not a day will go by
327-327	that he doesn't think of his own father.
328-329	I find myself drawn to this terrible place...
330-331	whose charred soil holds the remains of both my sister and my husband.
332-333	And I wonder how anything will ever grow again in this burned,
334-334	ruined earth.
335-335	I don't know where we go when we die.
336-336	But wherever you are,
337-337	I hope you have finally found
338-339	the peace you tried so hard to find in life.
340-340	For you and for all of us.
341-341	And I hope you can forgive me.
342-343	No one is denying the debt we owe Paya
344-345	for defeating Tormada and destroying his weapons.
346-347	I myself barely escaped his attack on our own government.
348-349	However, we cannot sign this, or any treaty,
350-351	with a nation that will allow sanctuary to the sighted.
352-353	We've all just borne witness to the destructive power of vision.
354-355	It is the position of the Trivantian people
356-357	that vision simply poses too much of a risk to all of us.
358-358	I understand your position.
359-360	But it was not vision that built Tormada's bombs,
361-362	but Tormada's cruel exploitation of sighted children
363-364	that accessed the knowledge of the ancients.
365-366	And it is that destructive knowledge, not vision itself,
367-367	that needs to be outlawed.
368-369	The sighted will always be the gateway to this knowledge.
370-371	And there will always be people like Tormada
372-372	who would choose to exploit them.
373-373	We stand with three sighted people,
374-375	all of whom have played a significant role in defeating Tormada
376-376	– and destroying his bombs.
377-377	– Yes.
378-379	And as we said earlier, we will grant them amnesty.
380-380	Why should we need amnesty?
381-381	We haven't done anything wrong.
382-382	Uh, in fact, i-if it weren't for us,
383-384	then Tormada and his bombs would be destroying your city right now.
385-385	Haniwa, now is not the time.
386-386	– No? When is the right time?
387-387	– Princess!
388-389	I fear you have forgotten who you're talking to.
390-390	I think it is you who has forgotten.
391-391	Ambassador, I apologize...
392-393	Vision is not coming back! It's already here.
394-394	And if I were you,
395-396	I'd be grateful that we are offering you peace,
397-398	because trust me, you do not want us as an enemy.
399-399	– Was that a threat?
400-400	– Of course not...
401-402	Ambassador, I apologize. You must understand,
403-404	my sister and I have been hunted our entire lives
405-405	simply because of how we were born.
406-407	The idea that I or anyone like me would be a threat
408-409	to the unsighted is based simply on superstition and fear,
410-410	and not the reality of who I am.
411-412	Because who I am has nothing to do with the fact that I can see.
413-413	I'm a son.
414-414	I'm a father.
415-415	I'm a Payan.
416-417	But most importantly, I'm your partner in peace.
418-418	So, please. May we continue?
419-419	Very well.
420-420	Haniwa.
421-421	Tak.
422-422	Tak.
423-423	Did she accept?
424-425	They agreed to talk more about it down the road.
426-426	But for now?
427-427	She has no choice.
428-429	She has to think of the kingdom. We cannot afford another war.
430-430	She promised to protect us.
431-431	She has an entire kingdom to protect.
432-432	And as prince and princess, so do we.
433-434	You don't really think that you're going to be king here, do you?
435-436	The people of Paya would never allow a sighted king.
437-438	And even if they did, the Trivantians wouldn't allow it.
439-439	You heard what they said there.
440-441	Forget being king or queen, Kofun. They don't even want us to exist!
442-442	– Why are you so angry?
443-443	– Why are you not?
444-444	We will never belong here.
445-445	This isn't our world.
446-446	This is where my family is.
447-447	This is where I'll raise my son.
448-449	Your son will always live in a different world than you.
450-450	My children will never forgive me.
451-452	You saved thousands of lives, including theirs.
453-454	You formed the beginnings of a true dialogue with Trivantes.
455-455	But vision is once again forbidden.
456-457	When I was young, my father used to fish for salmon.
458-459	Every autumn, he'd bring me down to the river,
460-460	and we'd fish.
461-462	For the first few days, we'd usually catch nothing.
463-463	Then one day, we'd catch one.
464-464	Two.
465-465	Hardly enough for a household.
466-467	But enough to know that the next day there'd be more.
468-468	Five salmon, ten salmon.
469-470	Soon the entire river would be teeming with salmon.
471-471	Vision is coming back.
472-473	You and I have met the first few fish swimming upstream.
474-474	More will come.
475-475	Some are, no doubt, already here.
476-476	Others will follow.
477-477	No law, no religion will stop it.
478-479	How we choose to handle it within our borders is our business.
480-481	The Trivantians made their position very clear.
482-483	Politicians following a script they know nothing about.
484-484	The war over vision will be fought,
485-486	not between Paya and Trivantes, but within cities.
487-487	Within families.
488-488	Within our own hearts.
489-489	Regardless, nature will have its way.
490-490	She always does.
491-491	Well...
492-493	you seem to have made your own peace with it.
494-495	The single advantage to being as horribly wrong
496-497	as I've been in my life is that new ideas are easier to accept.
498-498	Smells like death.
499-500	I think Baba always knew he would die in battle.
501-501	He told me once,
502-503	death must be earned every bit as much as life.
504-505	With his last breath, he defeated an entire army.
506-506	And by doing so, saved us all.
507-507	I think his death was well earned.
508-508	You sound a bit envious.
509-510	But while I'm still walking here on this earth,
511-512	I'll do my best to keep you out of trouble.
513-513	I would be lost without you, Tamacti.
514-514	How so very sad for both of us.
515-515	I miss him, Ranger.
516-516	Baba was a giant man,
517-518	so it makes sense that there's a giant-sized hole
519-519	in the space he used to fill.
520-520	You know, Baba died for you.
521-521	For all of us.
522-523	But it's important to remember not that he died for you,
524-524	but that he lived for you.
525-525	If he was here, that's what he would say.
526-526	I hear Lu has arrived.
527-527	Yes.
528-528	Yes, we head home tomorrow.
529-529	You're welcome to stay.
530-530	Thanks, um, but, uh, Lu and I,
531-532	we don't like crowds or people, you know, crowds of people.
533-533	Well, I could give you a horse.
534-534	Haniwa!
535-535	Charlotte?
536-536	Haniwa!
537-537	Nah, I'm not back. Not for long anyway.
538-538	I just needed to make sure you were okay.
539-539	I'm so sorry to hear about Baba.
540-541	Then I heard that you and Wren got married,
542-542	and I'm so happy about that.
543-544	And now I don't know if I should talk about the sad thing first
545-546	and then the happy thing? Or do it the other way,
547-548	or maybe you don't wanna talk about it at all.
549-550	How did it go with the Compass? How are Sheva and the kids?
551-551	Well, the little ones are great.
552-553	I don't think Sheva likes me very much.
554-555	But I don't like her either, so, you know, that'll work out.
556-556	She said you'd know what it means.
557-557	She wishes you a safe journey.
558-558	So... I take it you're going somewhere?
559-559	Will you come with us?
560-560	Not this time.
561-561	Who will keep me safe?
562-562	And she has you.
563-563	I am needed at the Compass.
564-565	Jerlamarel's children will be keeping us busy and...
566-566	I get the feeling more will be coming.
567-567	They are lucky to have you.
568-568	You be careful out there.
569-569	You too.
570-570	Thank you.
571-571	It was my pleasure.
572-572	I'm not crying.
573-573	Will you come find me?
574-574	You come find me.
575-576	Are you sure you don't want to say goodbye?
577-577	It wouldn't go well.
578-578	I'll see them again.
579-579	It's getting chilly.
580-580	Winter will be here soon.
581-582	It's been almost a year and still no word from Haniwa.
583-583	It could be a while till we hear from her.
584-584	Do you ever think about the Alkenny?
585-585	Every day.
586-586	Just the four of us, always together.
587-588	I'm sure we were sometimes cold, but in my memories it's always warm.
589-589	I thought when I became queen,
590-590	I would be able to give us that.
591-592	But once we set out to find the Lavender road,
593-594	we were never going to be that family again.
595-595	No.
596-596	But we are still a family.
597-597	You handle yourself well with the council.
598-598	You've earned their trust.
599-599	Maybe... you were born to do this.
600-601	Well, Haniwa says the kingdom would never accept a sighted king.
602-602	What do you say?
603-603	I know what Dad would say. He would say,
604-604	I think my eyes have betrayed me.
605-605	And they will again.
606-606	What are you saying?
607-608	My father died trying to save this kingdom.
609-610	If they weren't my people before, they are now.
611-611	I can't fully serve the people or my son
612-613	if my sense of the world is different from theirs.
614-614	I'm saying, I think I've seen enough.
615-616	I want to live in the same world as my son.
617-617	I want to hear, feel, smell what he does.
618-618	Kofun.
619-619	There's no going back.
620-620	You'd have to be absolutely sure.
621-621	I'm sure.
622-622	You made it.
623-623	You know us?
624-624	No. Not yet anyway.
625-625	But I am so glad you found us.
626-626	As I'm sure you can imagine,
627-628	everyone here has been on a journey very similar to your own.
629-629	I am Michaela. And you are?
630-630	Haniwa.
631-631	Wren.
632-632	Welcome, Haniwa and Wren.
633-634	Well, don't just stand there. Come down and meet everyone.
635-635	Welcome.
636-636	Hi.
