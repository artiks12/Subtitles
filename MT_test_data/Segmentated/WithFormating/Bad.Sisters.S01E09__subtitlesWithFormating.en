1-1	This is to tie it up.
2-2	Oh, no! And what happened there?
3-3	It's weird she hasn't called.
4-5	You'd call us if Donal didn't come home one night, right?
6-6	Don't know. Would I?
7-8	She'll probably call the police first, right?
9-9	Are you not talking to me?
10-10	I am talking to you. I'm still processing.
11-11	You shouldn't have let her go rogue.
12-13	Now she's got to carry that burden of guilt.
14-15	You weren't concerned about me when I was going to shoot him.
16-16	Or me.
17-17	Well, she's younger than...
18-18	She's practically a kid.
19-20	She's 29. What's the cutoff age for killing a man?
21-21	Anyway, we're not a firing squad.
22-23	We always knew one of us would get the final bullet.
24-24	Nice.
25-25	Becka.
26-26	Wait. Wait. Becka, wait!
27-27	– I can't breathe.
28-28	– There must've been tools in there!
29-29	– Was there tools in there?
30-30	– There's no tools. We checked!
31-31	– What happened?
32-32	– He's unkillable. He's like a cockroach.
33-33	Someone was in that room!
34-34	What am I missing?
35-36	Birthday planning! Get back in there, you big eavesdropper.
37-37	Get in.
38-38	– Get in!
39-39	– Sorry!
40-40	I have to go over there.
41-41	– No, wait, wait, wait. What do...
42-42	– Why is he here? He never comes.
43-44	It doesn't matter. It's good that he's here.
45-46	We'll keep him here while you check on Minna, okay?
47-48	Okay, look, walk! Don't run. We're gonna say you're sick.
49-49	I actually do feel sick.
50-51	So, Blanaid, did your daddy threaten to cancel your pocket money?
52-52	Is that what happened?
53-54	Road rage incident. Very angry chap. Um, got his license number though.
55-55	Um, JP, why don't you take a seat?
56-56	No. What? What... Stay.
57-57	You can, uh, have, uh... have Becka's seat.
58-58	Oh, yeah.
59-59	That's a great idea, JP. Stay.
60-60	No. I just wanted to drop the girls off.
61-62	I need to bring Mum her shopping. Should've done it last night.
63-63	Minna!
64-64	Minna, it's me!
65-65	Minna!
66-67	You called Becka. Leave a message, you weirdo.
68-69	Becka, he's going round there, so just... please...
70-70	Hey!
71-71	Will we serve up dessert?
72-72	Absolutely. Yeah, get stuck in.
73-73	Everyone's a bit weird today.
74-74	Are they?
75-75	Oh, my God.
76-76	– Mama! Where are you?
77-77	– Oh, shit. Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
78-79	Where are you? I've got some groceries for you.
80-81	Looks like you'll be eating fish fingers for a few days.
82-82	Mama!
83-83	Mama!
84-84	Where are you?
85-85	Mama!
86-86	But Mama, what are you doing?
87-87	What are you doing, Mama?
88-88	Oh, you're so cold!
89-89	I thought you were sick.
90-90	She's, um... She's sleeping.
91-91	– I'll come in and wait.
92-92	– No.
93-94	Don't like you hanging around here, giving her ideas.
95-95	Go away.
96-96	Ah, fuck!
97-97	Oh, Becka. Thank Christ!
98-98	He said she's sleeping.
99-99	What, you talked to him?
100-100	– I need to know.
101-101	– What did you say to him?
102-103	Nothing. I just said I fancied a Minna day.
104-104	I have to get in that house.
105-105	Look. I know this is awful, not knowing,
106-107	but forcing your way in there is only going to make things worse.
108-108	She's right.
109-110	We just need to act like normal, okay? Wait it out.
111-112	Go in and lie down. I'll get you a plate of food.
113-113	I can't eat.
114-115	Well, then I will bring you a box of wine, okay?
116-116	– Just go and lie down.
117-117	– I can't lie down.
118-119	Well, just pace about then, but do it here.
120-120	Not outside Minna's.
121-121	– If Minna's in there...
122-122	– I can't even think about that.
123-123	– I'm saying he might suspect...
124-124	– No. No, it looked like an accident.
125-125	If she is in there,
126-126	then he's the one with the problem.
127-127	What the...
128-128	What service do you require?
129-130	I just found my mother unresponsive in bed.
131-131	When was she last conscious? Do you know?
132-133	Hello? Excuse me, sir, are you still there?
134-134	Hey, honey.
135-136	I'm just here with all the girls. You all right?
137-138	I'm glad you're together. I... I didn't want Becka to be on her own.
139-139	Becka, Minna's dead.
140-140	No. Grace.
141-141	She passed away last night in her sleep.
142-142	If there's anything we can do, just...
143-143	John Paul needs me now. Talk later, okay?
144-145	Listen. Listen to me! None of this would have happened
146-147	if the prick hadn't have locked his dead dad in a fucking freezer!
148-149	She must have known George was in there. She must have gone to see him.
150-150	– I know. Yeah. Yeah.
151-151	– Or maybe she actually died in bed.
152-152	Christ's sake. He's covering his tracks!
153-154	No, he can't. He can't get away with this too.
155-156	I mean, if he's gonna lie about Minna, then I'll tell the truth about George.
157-158	I'll take him down even... Even if I go down too.
159-160	No. No, because if you go down, we all go down.
161-161	Shut up, Ursula!
162-163	We need to get in there before he moves his body.
164-164	– And... And do what?
165-165	– I... I don't know! Photograph it!
166-166	– And... And then what?
167-167	– We can't go to the police.
168-168	You do get that, don't you, Becka?
169-169	I don't want to hear her.
170-170	Just, please.
171-172	Okay. Better we have a photograph than no photograph.
173-173	– No.
174-174	– Just so we have something
175-175	to use against him if we need it.
176-176	No, it's too risky.
177-178	Well, I'm going over there with or without you lot.
179-179	No, I'll... I'll come with you. Okay?
180-180	What the hell? Where is he?
181-181	I can't believe this is happening.
182-182	Becka.
183-183	I need to get out of here.
184-184	Okay.
185-185	What are you doing here?
186-186	– We were just...
187-187	– I wanted to see the...
188-188	See what?
189-190	We were just... Becka thought she left some massage equipment here, so we...
191-191	What? In the freezer room?
192-193	We didn't go into any freezer room. We... We were just going. Sorry.
194-194	Becka, I know you were here last night.
195-195	You pierced her nose.
196-197	I took it out 'cause it made her look cheap.
198-198	Sorry for your loss.
199-199	What else would we be doing down there?
200-200	– He knows we know about George.
201-201	– I don't care if he knows.
202-202	I care that Minna is dead.
203-203	– I-I care that I did it.
204-204	– Yeah, we did it.
205-205	You didn't even know about it.
206-206	I started this. We are all guilty.
207-207	– Oh, shit. Does he know that?
208-208	– I mean, does he know that we...
209-209	Stop talking about him.
210-210	My heart is gonna break, Eva.
211-212	I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.
213-213	Becka. B...
214-214	Becka!
215-215	You totally went off radar.
216-216	You didn't tell me you dug up JP's body.
217-218	So tell me the truth because, um, my brother is losing his mind.
219-220	Funny enough, Matt, I don't care about your brother.
221-221	I care about my sister.
222-223	You're not paying her what she's due. Why's that?
224-225	Yeah, we were out driving or messing. I was pissed.
226-227	I made Eva take me to Gabriel's boat. I thought we could have a drink on board.
228-228	So, you didn't see JP's car?
229-230	We didn't notice any cars. We were looking at the boats.
231-231	Why are you asking?
232-233	And this bullshit friendship with Minna. What was that about?
234-234	It wasn't a bullshit friendship.
235-236	I saw the check she made out to you, Becka.
237-237	The antique check?
238-238	Did you notice it wasn't cashed?
239-240	You wouldn't understand anything about that
241-242	because all you and your brother can think about is money.
243-244	Coming from the woman who was happy to take a handout from a man she hated.
245-245	That's not what...
246-247	Oh, was it a coincidence she died a few weeks before John Paul...
248-248	– Yes, it was a fucking coincidence!
249-249	– Oh, you're a hypocrite, Becka!
250-250	And you use people.
251-252	You saw Minna and took an opportunity. You're doing the same with me.
253-254	You're the hypocrite! You pretended to like me.
255-255	– Minna was my friend, and I miss her!
256-256	– Stop, Becka.
257-257	– I miss her!
258-258	– Stop.
259-259	I'm sorry.
260-260	I'm sorry.
261-261	Hey. Is everything okay?
262-262	Yeah.
263-263	Where are you?
264-264	You're with her.
265-265	– Yeah.
266-266	– You're a fool. She's lying to you.
267-268	They killed him in Wick low. I can't prove it, but I know they did it.
269-269	Someone want a little cuddle?
270-270	Tom? Tom?
271-271	You have to pay out? Is that what this is?
272-272	Well, at least it's done. Over.
273-273	I've been trying so hard.
274-274	I care about you and having this baby.
275-275	Look, come here.
276-277	We can live in a box out the back of a Harvey Norman.
278-279	I don't give a shit as long as I have you both.
280-280	Matt's in love with the Garvey girl.
281-281	Well, I told you that.
282-283	I'd like a face-to-face with those Garveys.
284-284	What is she like?
285-285	Aside from being an accomplice to murder?
286-286	There's something else, isn't there?
287-288	If we can't pay the Williams claim, there will be an investigation.
289-289	– Right. And?
290-290	– And...
291-291	Well, they'll find a mess.
292-292	– What kind of mess?
293-293	– A fraudulent mess.
294-295	The Williams case was never processed. There was no cover.
296-297	Dad just took the monthly payments, and he spent them.
298-298	If there's an investigation,
299-300	they'll find that and all the other policies
301-302	that weren't worth the paper they were written on.
303-304	He embezzled his clients for years, and I've helped to cover it up.
305-305	Are you talking jail time, Thomas?
306-306	– Sorry for your loss.
307-307	– Don't bring him on us, Eva.
308-308	Why? It's so much fun.
309-309	Minna would've hated this.
310-310	She deserved a proper send-off.
311-311	Yeah. A dry funeral.
312-313	She was always half-pissed every time I saw her.
314-314	She had dementia, Bibi.
315-315	No, I mean on top of that.
316-317	This was her favorite. I'll drink to her if no one else will.
318-318	That's not gonna help, honey.
319-319	That is rich coming from you.
320-320	I need a breather from her.
321-321	Make sure she doesn't do anything stupid.
322-322	– What happened?
323-323	– Doesn't matter.
324-324	He's calling it a road rage incident.
325-325	I had a word with him.
326-326	– What did you say?
327-327	– I told him to stay away.
328-328	– And then you hit him?
329-329	– Yes, I hit him.
330-330	Christ's sake, Ben.
331-331	Why did you have to fan the flame?
332-332	Did anyone see you?
333-333	What do you expect me to do?
334-335	After what he did to you, the scumbag should be in jail.
336-336	Show me your hand.
337-337	You did that for me?
338-338	I'd do anything for you, Urs.
339-339	People keep saying it was her time.
340-340	Well, she had a long life.
341-341	But she wasn't ready to die.
342-343	I think your mother died the day you told her that George had left her.
344-344	All she did was find her way back to him.
345-345	Hey.
346-346	Hey. You okay?
347-348	I'm grand, really. I'm just worried about this man.
349-349	– Mmm.
350-350	– Yeah.
351-351	Let's get away, Mammy.
352-353	Go up to the cabin for your birthday. Dust off the quad bike.
354-355	And she's gonna be spending her birthday with her sisters like she always does.
356-356	She's my wife, and she spends it with me.
357-357	Cabin's not ready. It's a building site.
358-358	Just needs a woman's touch, really.
359-360	Well, how about you lot join us the next morning,
361-362	and we could have a half day at the hotel spa?
363-364	We all got drunk at the bar and then went back to the cabin.
365-366	We're not doing a rerun of that car crash of a night.
367-367	No drunken stragglers this time.
368-368	I'm fine. I'll see you later.
369-369	Eva.
370-370	– Um, I'll call you. I love you.
371-371	– Oh, okay. I love you. Yeah, do.
372-372	Becka!
373-373	You all right, Pebble?
374-375	Mmm, yeah, we're okay. I'm worried about John Paul and...
376-376	Grace.
377-377	Oscar.
378-378	We are restructuring, Eva.
379-380	Where formerly, staff came to you to sign off on client accounts,
381-381	they will now come to me.
382-382	And that includes you.
383-383	And you agree to this?
384-385	JP says there have been some errors of late, um...
386-386	– What, and you believe him?
387-387	– Yes, I believe him, Eva.
388-389	You've been distracted recently. Not yourself at all, if I'm honest.
390-390	And there's been complaints.
391-392	There's been complaints? Well, what exactly...
393-394	From clients, um, about the smell of drink off you.
395-396	And not just your breath. You're sweating alcohol, it seems...
397-397	Which says something.
398-398	Eva. Eva.
399-399	Grace will be upset by this,
400-401	so I hope we can keep it civil for her sake.
402-402	Because, Eva, I'm not going anywhere.
403-404	I know Becka was there the night that Minna died,
405-406	and I wondered, “Why would she want to hurt Minna?”
407-407	But there's no answer.
408-409	And then I had this strange memory of seeing her in my bedroom
410-410	the night I fell into the marina.
411-412	And I thought, “Ah, come on. Don't be stupid. How could that be?”
413-414	But here she is again, one more time, in a place where she shouldn't be.
415-416	And then, I remembered something else this morning.
417-418	I remembered the Garvey girls are like rats.
419-420	Where there's one, there's more, which is why you need to poison the nest.
421-422	Get away from my car, or I will mow you down like roadkill.
423-423	Okay, sure. No problem. Please.
424-424	– Emergency. Which service?
425-425	– Jesus, that was quick.
426-427	Yeah, no. Okay. No. We're not doing that. No, no. Okay, we got it.
428-428	Kept him in the freezer for years.
429-429	Jesus Christ. That's why she...
430-430	Sorry!
431-431	Thank you!
432-432	I didn't believe her about George, Eva.
433-433	Okay.
434-435	She's been sick, so should be the worst of it over.
436-436	– Okay.
437-437	– It was all over the grave though,
438-439	so you might want to call Father Doyle in the morning.
440-440	Offer to sluice it out or...
441-442	Father D... Yeah. No, I will. I-I'll do that. Yeah.
443-444	They're not listening to me! Tell them I killed Minna.
445-445	I'll kill you in a second.
446-447	Hey, do you know, if you have any Dioralyte at home, that'll help.
448-448	Brilliant idea. Thank you.
449-449	Nice house!
450-450	Thank you.
451-451	Tell them!
452-452	Please shut up.
453-454	Oh, my God. I can't believe she spoke to the police.
455-455	– Just calm down. It was two local morons.
456-456	– She's a liability.
457-458	I told you this is what would happen if you involved her, didn't I?
459-459	I am fucking here, you know.
460-460	Look, I know this is hard,
461-462	okay, but you are just gonna have to find a way to carry it.
463-463	That's easy for you to say.
464-464	He didn't take your eye or blackmail you.
465-465	Put blood on your hands.
466-466	Sorry. I know what he did to you.
467-467	Gabriel and your work.
468-469	That euthanasia drug that you were telling us about.
470-470	– Can you get that at the hospital?
471-471	– What the hell, Eva?
472-473	No, I'm gonna finish this. I'm gonna do it this weekend in Wick low.
474-474	No. No.
475-476	We are going there to give Grace a decent birthday.
477-478	What he said to me at work, that was a threat.
479-479	He is onto us now.
480-480	– He's onto us?
481-481	– Well, what exactly does he know?
482-482	– It's what he suspects.
483-483	– Which is what?
484-485	That Becka had something to do with Minna's death,
486-486	– or that we're trying to kill him?
487-487	– I don't know.
488-488	All of it.
489-489	Can you get it?
490-490	Pentobarbital? Not from work, no.
491-492	It's too dangerous to rush into it like this. You're being completely reckless.
493-494	You're the one who wanted him dead in the first place.
495-495	I could do it.
496-496	I've got blood on my hands anyway.
497-497	Might as well be hung for a sheep.
498-498	No one's getting hung.
499-499	This is mine.
500-500	I can do this. I know I can.
501-501	Is that a fact?
502-503	'Cause right now, I think you are more of a liability than she is.
504-504	We are not doing it.
505-505	Get the stuff.
506-506	I'll be back in an hour.
507-508	Don't look so worried. I won't tell him anything.
509-509	I just want to suss out the legalities.
510-511	No point in having a solicitor for a pal if you don't use them, right?
512-512	You don't have pals.
513-513	That's true.
514-514	I love you, Thomas.
515-515	I know.
516-516	No.
517-517	Gotcha, Becka Garvey.
518-518	Forgot me bloody wallet.
519-520	Figured I'd have to buy him a drink at least or-or something.
521-521	Theresa.
522-523	Theresa! Theresa! Theresa, you okay? Can you hear me?
524-525	Fuck! You're all right. You're all right.
526-526	– What service do you require?
527-527	– Hello? I need an ambulance!
528-529	I felt a bit weird picking out knickers for Theresa,
530-530	Hey. Hey, wait. Thomas. What's going on?
531-531	– She had a seizure.
532-532	– What?
533-534	I just had some 23-year-old with the emotional depth of a Chihuahua
535-535	lay it out for me.
536-537	I could lose her. I could lose my baby. I could lose them both.
538-539	No, it won't... You won't lose them, Thomas.
540-541	She was going to see Becka Garvey. Did you know that?
542-543	That's what she was doing before she collapsed.
544-544	This is my fault.
545-546	I dumped all this shite at the end of her bed.
547-547	Expected her to, what,
548-549	just watch us two running around like headless chickens?
550-551	I don't think I can cope if things go wrong in there.
552-553	Things will not go wrong in there, all right?
554-555	And I've got the mess out here. Okay? I have it.
556-556	Thomas.
557-557	Hey, I miss you. Where'd you go?
558-558	Am I not worth investigating anymore?
559-560	Hey. I don't know if you remember me. I was in last week.
561-562	Yeah. I know. Um, listen, I showed you a photo...
563-563	You having a drink?
564-564	Uh, no, no. I'm okay. I'm just, um...
565-565	And, uh, whatever you're having.
566-567	So, I asked if this lad was in watching the match on the Friday.
568-568	Yeah, I think so.
569-569	Hang on. You said you were certain before.
570-570	Did I?
571-572	Yeah, no. Yeah, you definitely did 'cause I-I took notes.
573-573	Probably. Look, I don't know.
574-574	– I don't have a photograph memory.
575-575	– Uh, okay.
576-577	Now, this one, she was in on the Friday definitely.
578-579	Drank double whiskeys. Didn't buy any herself, might I add.
580-580	Oh, come on.
581-581	– Matt?
582-582	– Tom? Tom?
583-583	– I can't talk, Matt.
584-584	– I have proof
585-585	– that the sisters were lying.
586-586	– What?
587-587	They weren't all together that night.
588-589	The night Williams died? I fucking knew it.
590-591	The next couple of days are just about Grace, all right?
592-593	Nobody tries anything, nobody goes it alone. Okay?
594-594	No plans to. I need a drink.
595-595	Makes me feel alive!
596-596	Here we go!
597-597	JP?
598-598	Hold on tight, Mammy!
599-599	I've got this.
600-600	I know you were Oscar.
601-602	And I know you got me in trouble with the police.
603-603	– Um, Roger...
604-604	– No. I don't want to hear lies.
605-605	I came here to ask you a question.
606-606	Ask away.
607-607	Why did you do it?
608-608	You were my friend.
609-610	Well, perhaps because I didn't like you sniffing around my family,
611-611	because we are not friends.
612-612	And we never were.
613-614	You're just a sad old man from across the street
615-616	that we tolerate because we're nice people.
617-618	And because you probably would fiddle with kids if you could, wouldn't you?
619-619	And I forgive you.
620-620	Forgiveness flows down.
621-621	Remember that.
622-623	Have any of you heard from Eva? She's not answering me.
624-624	We need to get hammered. Like, medically.
625-625	– Three double whiskeys?
626-626	– Actually, make it two.
627-627	What? Why?
628-628	Ben is staying nearby.
629-629	It's my last night with him.
630-630	Does he know that?
631-631	Not yet.
632-633	Anyway, I'll be back bright and early to take us all to Grace's.
634-635	Don't believe any of that “last night together” crap.
636-636	The horny bitch.
637-637	Pub?
638-638	No. I think I'm just gonna hit the sack.
639-639	Would you text me when Eva gets back?
640-640	You know Ursula got the pen to?
641-641	What?
642-643	Eva wouldn't do anything without telling us.
644-644	What, you think she's gonna do it?
645-645	I think she thinks she's gonna.
646-646	What does that mean?
647-647	Becka?
648-648	Becka!
649-650	I was just thinking how nice it is when it's just the two of us.
651-652	Do you really have to go and see your sisters tomorrow?
653-653	Oh, JP, it's too late to cancel now.
654-654	And I'll be back by lunch.
655-656	Your sisters never really liked me, did they?
657-657	But do you know how much it hurts
658-659	when I feel that you love them more than me?
660-660	But that's not true.
661-661	Good.
662-662	To “just us.”
663-663	Just us.
664-664	Becka?
665-665	I wish he'd leave us alone.
666-667	Without him, we could go back to the way we were.
668-668	Oi.
669-669	Where did you go last night?
670-670	Very muddy pub.
671-671	Jesus.
672-672	What is wrong with you?
673-673	Just checking you're here.
674-674	Where else would I be?
675-675	Ben?
676-676	Shit!
677-677	Think I should call Urs?
678-679	Why? She's barely phoning it in these days.
680-680	What's wrong?
681-681	I don't wanna go in.
682-682	No, I will not.
683-683	Just put your party hats on and be normal.
684-684	Put your party hat on. Please.
685-685	Please!
686-686	And your party face.
687-687	That's better.
688-689	John Paul is dead. He's dead, Eva. He's dead.
