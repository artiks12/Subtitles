1	It took me a long time
2	and some hard lessons
3	to learn what I know
4	about love, fate, and chasing redemption.
5	But it started with a simple choice,
6	escape or die.
7	Back in here at one o'clock, you bludgers.
8	– Yeah, yeah.
9	– I know.
10	– Ooh, here he comes.
11	– Hello, doggy.
12	– You're in trouble now, mate.
13	– Dead man!
14	You're gonna get yours, dog.
15	You're a dead man.
16	They let Barnes out of the slot.
17	He's got friends in high places,
18	hasn't he?
19	I'm not ready.
20	Dale, would you just forget
21	about escaping?
22	Tell that bloody cop
23	what he wants to know.
24	And then what? I'm not a dog, Ned.
25	Well, every fucking convict out there
26	already thinks that you are.
27	Shit, Barnes,
28	he almost killed you last time, didn't he?
29	What, you think
30	he's just gonna not finish the job?
31	– Fuck it. I'm going now.
32	– You're what?
33	Dale! What about me?
34	You gotta take me with you.
35	Dale. Dale!
36	It's nearly one o'clock.
37	It's never gonna work with these things.
38	Dale, we've gotta go back.
39	Dale, listen to me!
40	We can get back onto the wing
41	before the next count.
42	There's a buzz saw downstairs.
43	– No. They'll know it was missing.
44	– Or they won't.
45	– It won't work.
46	– It will work.
47	Because they'd never think a convict
48	would be stupid enough to use a power saw
49	to escape over the front wall.
50	And they'd be bloody well right.
51	Fuck this, man. We have to go back.
52	Mate, I can't go back.
53	– Come on, come on.
54	– You four.
55	Fuck.
56	Stay tight. They can't see us from here.
57	Okay.
58	How high is it?
59	– Thirty, 40 feet, maybe.
60	– Uh-huh.
61	We could bloody break our legs.
62	– Move.
63	– Dale, I'm scared of heights.
64	You're gonna be fine, mate.
65	You know what? You go, all right?
66	I'm gonna go back, but you go.
67	– For fuck's sake. Calm down.
68	– Just let me go. I can't fucking do this.
69	You can't go back.
70	'Cause then they're gonna know I'm gone.
71	– Yeah b...
72	– Hey, yeah. Mate, you're going first.
73	Fuck.
74	In that moment,
75	I was waiting for the rifle shot.
76	I didn't dare think I might be free.
77	The cops been here?
78	No.
79	Where did you go before coming here?
80	I didn't.
81	Not to your mother?
82	That's the first place they'd be waiting.
83	I was the next person you thought of. Why?
84	I don't know.
85	I didn't give it much thought.
86	I just jumped the wall and got away.
87	I didn't have much of a plan beyond that.
88	Well, I'm sure you have friends who can be
89	much more use in your current situation.
90	Practically, I mean, to a fugitive.
91	You're not my student anymore, Dale.
92	And I'm not in the business
93	of helping escaped convicts.
94	Sir, I had to escape.
95	They were gonna kill me in there.
96	I really didn't have a choice.
97	Choice is all you have.
98	I mean, I can't go back to college.
99	I can't be a paramedic.
100	There's not much left.
101	I was so proud...
102	...of getting out of where I came from,
103	of how proud my mum was...
104	proud of what you saw in me.
105	And now look at me.
106	I'm a failed student, a failed son...
107	You're better than all those things.
108	No.
109	No, I know what I did...
110	what I need to pay for.
111	Dying in prison
112	wasn't gonna make it right.
113	You haven't escaped anything
114	unless you go on to something, so...
115	what do you want to be?
116	I wanna be the man I was gonna be
117	before all of this.
118	You can't. Not here. Not anymore.
119	Then I have to leave.
120	Why?
121	Because I know who you really are.
122	And I think you came here
123	to have someone remind you of it.
124	No more guns, Dale.
125	No more armed robberies or heroin.
126	Don't you make me into a fool.
127	Ladies and gentlemen,
128	welcome to Bombay.
129	While opening the overhead compartments...
130	– Go. Go on.
131	– ...please take care.
132	The first thing I noticed was the smell.
133	In that first Bombay minute,
134	I didn't recognize it.
135	But I do now. It was the smell of hope.
136	– Next.
137	– Ladies and gentlemen,
138	welcome to Bombay International Airport...
139	But standing there
140	with another man's name and fake passport,
141	hope and fear felt much the same.
142	Good morning, sir!
143	I am number one guide in Bombay.
144	I know everything there is to know
145	about my golden city.
146	You are in need of assistance?
147	I can show you everything.
148	– Hey... Thank you, but no.
149	– Sir, let me assist you, sir.
150	Yes, sir.
151	But forgive me, sir,
152	this was only a one-time no, huh?
153	And here in my India,
154	a one-time no is not a true no.
155	Yeah? So what's a true no?
156	Only after three noes, it is a true no.
157	Please, sir, allow me
158	to show you cheap, clean hotel.
159	And after, you decide what to pay.
160	What if I decide to pay nothing?
161	Then that is your choice, sir.
162	But I don't believe
163	it's a choice you'll be making.
164	I am number one guide in Bombay.
165	Yes, sir. Very big, sir. Everyone agrees.
166	You are knowing me too well.
167	– Ah, you want to see our merch?
168	– No.
169	Sir.
170	Myself, Prabhu.
171	Lindsay.
172	– Lin-see.
173	– Lindsay.
174	Lin-see. Sir, don't mind, huh?
175	But...
176	...this is a not-so-good name.
177	It is too long and squeaky
178	for, uh, how Indian people speak.
179	– Okay.
180	– I think short name, short name.
181	– That's...
182	– “Lin” is better.
183	– Yeah, no problem.
184	– You do not object? I can call you Lin?
185	– Uh, Lin's fine.
186	– Very good.
187	Also, it has a very lucky meaning.
188	– Oh, yeah? What's that?
189	– “Great penis.”
190	Great penis?
191	It is not meaning this exactly,
192	but it is sounding like ling,
193	and that is meaning, “great big penis.”
194	it is full power name, too lucky name.
195	Everyone will love this name
196	when they hear it. You'll see.
197	Okay, you win.
198	Show me a hotel.
199	Sir, come, sir.
200	You like?
201	I like.
202	Where are you coming from?
203	New Zealand.
204	How's that working for you?
205	That why we're here, to debate philosophy?
206	What, you think you're too clever for me,
207	do you, Dale?
208	I'm just a dumb policeman.
209	But years of experience
210	has given me a philosophy
211	based on, uh, you know, empiric research
212	that, just like day follows night,
213	every man succumbs to his nature,
214	even a smart boy like you.
215	You think your mother's proud?
216	I was watching her in the courtroom,
217	blaming herself.
218	– Well, you broke her heart.
219	– Don't talk about her.
220	You know why you are worse
221	than all the scumbags in here?
222	Because you had
223	the chance to be different.
224	All the advantages she worked so hard
225	to give you, and yet here you are.
226	And a good man is dead.
227	Who killed Officer Floris?
228	Give me the name.
229	Come on, mate.
230	I can't remember.
231	You will.
232	Wake up, Linbaba!
233	I have so much to show you.
234	Should we take this
235	white motherfucker the long way round?
236	Chai also.
237	– I pay?
238	– Mmm.
239	How long
240	has this motherfucker been in town?
241	What is this “maderchod?”
242	Oh, “motherfucker.”
243	Very good curse, Linbaba.
244	Everyone is using it.
245	Bloody hell!
246	Is he fucking mad?
247	And if we stop for lunch...
248	How much do you charge
249	this white motherfucker?
250	Who are you calling “motherfucker?”
251	I was a wanted man
252	with a price on my head,
253	on the run with no home and no country.
254	But for now, I was free.
255	Every day on the run is your whole life.
256	And there's hope and excitement
257	in the new.
258	I don't really need any fabric.
259	You know, I'll come back maybe tomorrow.
260	Tomorrow. Tomorrow.
261	You're lucky I was here.
262	Maybe you're my guardian angel.
263	There's too much devil in me for that.
264	– How much devil are we talking?
265	– Hey, Karla! Come on.
266	If you come to Reynaldo's sometime,
267	maybe you'll get to find out.
268	Oh, Karla!
269	– Who is this?
270	– You made a new friend?
271	You found it then. I'm Karla Saaranen.
272	Lindsay Ford. People call me Lin.
273	They do?
274	Yeah, I'm aware of
275	the whole “great penis” thing.
276	Just “penis,” no “great.”
277	Just means, you know, everyday,
278	average, kind of...
279	All right.
280	Beware her riddles
281	and her seductions, young man.
282	– Didier Levy.
283	– Lindsay Ford.
284	– Were you leaving?
285	– Yeah? Just got here.
286	Then why on earth are we standing?
287	Come. Join us.
288	You can stand to eat a meal if you must.
289	You can stand to make love if you're able,
290	but it's impossible to stand and drink.
291	It's the act of a barbarian,
292	an animal at the watering hole.
293	...the same.
294	Reynaldo's was an unofficial free zone,
295	scrupulously ignored by the local police.
296	Didier was a permanent fixture,
297	putting together buyers and sellers of
298	anything that could earn him a commission.
299	But strict rules apply to
300	all the business conducted there.
301	Deals for drugs and contraband
302	were openly transacted at the tables,
303	but these agreements could only be sealed
304	on the pavement outside.
305	Hookers, dealers, gamblers and gangsters.
306	Men who might kill each other any day
307	and knew it.
308	But, in Reynaldo's,
309	no blood was ever spilt.
310	Dangerous man, that one. Rafiq.
311	He used to run a black market in books.
312	– Books?
313	– Passports.
314	Rafiq is bitter
315	about losing his book business.
316	Men were killed.
317	– What about that guy?
318	– The victor.
319	Abdullah Taheri.
320	He works for Abdel Khader Khan,
321	one of the great crime lords of the city.
322	Didier, you talk too much.
323	What, are you expecting
324	many serious injuries here in Bombay,
325	huh, Linbaba?
326	Force of habit. I was an ambo back home.
327	– Ambo?
328	– I drove an ambulance.
329	Better w-we pretend you're a doctor.
330	We could be making
331	so much money like this.
332	Many patients I could bring you
333	for a small commission.
334	Better we don't mention it at all.
335	Very cool, these sunglasses.
336	Like Amitabh in Trishul.
337	Don't do that.
338	It's style, boss.
339	Do you wanna swap?
340	But... In all honesty,
341	these are cheap and not so good.
342	Do you want them or not?
343	Why you do this?
344	Because you're my mate.
345	– What?
346	– I walked here barefoot
347	'cause a guy came in my shoes.
348	He looked totally straight,
349	then I went into the bathroom.
350	Oh, my God.
351	Ugh, Lisa.
352	– Mmm, poor darling.
353	– How do I wear them now?
354	Lisa was an old friend of Karla's.
355	Somehow sad and sexy as hell
356	all at the same time.
357	Crazy people love me.
358	Have I told you to get fucked yet, Didier?
359	You should do an interview, Lisa.
360	Anonymous, of course.
361	– Yes.
362	– People will be fascinated by your story.
363	They will be fascinated
364	by the man who came in her shoes?
365	– Yeah.
366	– Who would read this, Kavvie?
367	Vikram Khanna was a Bollywood stuntman.
368	His sister Kavita was a journalist.
369	Smart and ambitious
370	and eager to make her mark.
371	What brings you to Bombay, Lin?
372	Tell her nothing, Lin.
373	In Bombay,
374	everyone's story is their own to keep,
375	which drives Kavvie crazy.
376	Wherever Lisa went, her pimps
377	Maurizio and Modena
378	– were never far away.
379	– This is Lin. He's from New Zealand.
380	Lin, Maurizio and Modena.
381	Lin.
382	Means “prick” in Hindi, right?
383	It takes a prick to know one.
384	My grandmother was from Padova.
385	Any other languages we should know about,
386	just to avoid further embarrassment?
387	I swear pretty good
388	in Marathi and Hindi these days.
389	I can even speak
390	fluent American if the occasion demands.
391	It's pretty good. Do some more.
392	Well, I'm not asking you to forgive me.
393	I'll never understand or forgive myself.
394	And if a bullet gets me, so help me,
395	I'll laugh at myself for being an idiot.
396	But there's one thing I do know.
397	That is that I love you, Scarlett.
398	Wow.
399	– Arre, do Clint Eastwood. Can you?
400	– Yeah. Yeah.
401	“Well,
402	you gotta ask yourself one question.”
403	“Do I feel lucky?”
404	“Well, do you, punk?”
405	– What is...
406	– It's Dirty Harry.
407	Is that Clint?
408	If it's not a Western, I'm not seeing it.
409	You should be an actor or something, Lin.
410	And we should have dinner sometime.
411	You can talk American to me all night.
412	I'd like that.
413	Bye, bye, bye.
414	– Ciao, Maurizio.
415	– Ciao.
416	– Oh, nice, nice. Ciao, Maurizio.
417	– Bye.
418	– He didn't look happy, yaar.
419	– I think you embarrassed him.
420	Those first few weeks, I watched
421	all of the seekers come and then leave,
422	heading for the “real India,”
423	seeking enlightenment and solitude
424	and self-contemplation.
425	But I'd had my share of that forced on me.
426	Instead, Bombay felt exhilaratingly free,
427	a place where everyone started new.
428	And I responded to that with all my heart.
429	You should get out of Bombay, Lin.
430	This is the place they were thinking about
431	when they invented the word “the pits.”
432	You should go to Varanasi or Rajasthan.
433	I don't know. I like it here.
434	And perhaps Bombay offers our Lin
435	things he won't find anywhere else.
436	N'est-ce pas?
437	Give this to Karla for me?
438	Tell her I said not to worry.
439	I'm a big girl.
440	– Ciao, Didier. Lin.
441	– Oh, Maurizio.
442	Andiamo. We don't want
443	to keep Madame Zhou waiting, hmm?
444	What's that all about?
445	In matters of food, I am French.
446	In matters of love, I am Italian.
447	But in matters of business, I am Swiss,
448	strictly neutral,
449	especially with other people's business.
450	And I advise you to be the same.
451	Now, if you'll excuse me,
452	I see a man who might be
453	of great consequence to my fortunes.
454	Bonne chance, Lin.
455	– Something I said?
456	– No, he's just got business to attend to.
457	– Looked like your meeting went well?
458	– It did, actually. Very well.
459	You just missed Lisa.
460	She gave me something for you.
461	Walk with me?
462	I like that you haven't asked
463	what this is for.
464	None of my business.
465	Yet here you are. How come?
466	Lisa asked. I like her.
467	Well, Lisa would spend all her money
468	on dope if I let her.
469	I told her she needs to save some
470	in case she ever needs it.
471	I hold it for her.
472	– “Fuck you money.”
473	– Exactly.
474	She'll never use it.
475	Even more than the heroin,
476	Lisa needs to feel looked after,
477	even if it's by men like Maurizio
478	who get her into trouble.
479	Maybe she'll surprise you one day.
480	I doubt it. She is what she is.
481	You don't think people can change?
482	They have to want to.
483	I think life's like a crowded lifeboat.
484	Maybe you throw out your pride
485	to stay afloat,
486	maybe your self-respect
487	and your independence.
488	friends, everyone you used to know,
489	and it's still not enough.
490	The boat is still sinking,
491	and you're going down with it.
492	That's Lisa.
493	She'll never get out of the boat.
494	You're a good listener.
495	That's dangerous
496	because it's so hard to resist.
497	Being listened to...
498	Really listened to...
499	It's rare.
500	Makes a person feel special.
501	Okay, now you're taking
502	this good-listener thing a little too far.
503	...for business interests
504	from the West and here in Bombay.
505	And then I realized
506	if I was the one making the deals happen,
507	why not make them happen myself.
508	Bombay is changing fast.
509	There's a lot of money to be made here.
510	Is money what you want?
511	What I want is to be master
512	of my own destiny.
513	Money gives you that freedom.
514	Have I disappointed you, Lin?
515	No. No, not at all.
516	I think freedom is all you can ask for,
517	however you find it.
518	What does your freedom look like?
519	To be able to choose where to be,
520	what to do...
521	with who.
522	Then I'm honored.
523	This is me.
524	I'm sorry to have kept you so late.
525	You should grab a taxi. I'll pay.
526	I'll walk.
527	Good way to get to know the city.
528	Then thank you,
529	for this and for walking with me.
530	I enjoyed it.
531	Yeah, me too.
532	Fuck.
533	– Come here.
534	– Hey!
535	Where are you going?
536	Nowhere. Just a tourist.
537	I got a little bit turned around.
538	Hey, it's past curfew.
539	There's a curfew?
540	Show us your papers.
541	Show your passport.
542	Look, breaking curfew, very bad.
543	– I think you should go to jail.
544	– Ah, come...
545	Hey! Would you like to go to jail, gora?
546	No.
547	I think you would not like
548	to go to jail at all, Mr...
549	Listen, I'm leaving Bombay.
550	It's time I moved on.
551	Where?
552	I don't know. Goa maybe? Varanasi?
553	– When?
554	– Tomorrow. This'll be our last day.
555	Yeah, yeah. These places all the goras
556	are going to, I don't think you'll like.
557	– Can't stay here forever.
558	– No, I know this.
559	But you should go
560	to a real Indian village, na?
561	Listen.
562	I'm listening.
563	If you are wanting,
564	I could take some time from my schedule
565	and take you to my village.
566	I've never offered to take a gora before,
567	but you are my good friend.
568	One train, two bus rides.
569	It is beautiful there.
570	You'll come, na?
571	I would be honored.
572	And I will charge
573	same as Bombay only, huh?
574	One hundred rupees a day.
575	Hey, very generous of you to offer, Lin.
576	I accept.
577	– Who is it?
578	– Karla.
579	Laundry day?
580	Yep.
581	I'm leaving town.
582	Were you gonna say goodbye?
583	Yeah, I was gonna
584	come by Reynaldo's tonight.
585	Come in.
586	These are quite something.
587	Yeah. Tough paper round.
588	What's going on?
589	I was hoping you'd maybe help me
590	with something.
591	Okay.
592	Lisa's in a really bad situation.
593	Maurizio convinced her
594	to work in a brothel called the Palace.
595	It isn't good. It caters for all tastes.
596	And Madame Zhou, the woman
597	who runs the place, is pretty scary.
598	What about Maurizio?
599	Maurizio doesn't give a shit
600	about anyone but himself.
601	Parker was coming with me to demand
602	Lisa's release as an American citizen.
603	Sounds like a good plan.
604	It was, until Parker left town.
605	I can't stand the idea
606	of Lisa being prisoner in that place.
607	And then I thought of you
608	doing your accents the other day.
609	Lisa said you were pretty good.
610	And you thought
611	I could pretend to be this guy?
612	Yeah.
613	I... Look, Karla, I'm sorry, but... I can't.
614	You could.
615	I mean, you're not just some tourist
616	out to see the world, Lin,
617	or I wouldn't be here.
618	Maybe that's why I can't get involved.
619	Everyone here is running away
620	from something.
621	Yeah, I know.
622	And I plan to keep right on going.
623	It doesn't work. Trust me.
624	You can be free of anything but yourself.
625	You don't know anything about me.
626	But I thought
627	there was something worth knowing.
628	Guess I was wrong.
629	One way or another,
630	you're gonna say the words.
631	So let's just get to it, huh?
632	Who pulled the trigger?
633	I'm not a dog.
634	I'm here to be punished for what I did.
635	No, no, no.
636	Doesn't fucking work like that.
637	You don't get to feel better.
638	Punishment is punishment. Pain is pain.
639	This isn't a path to a better place, kid.
640	Huh?
641	This is all you've got coming.
642	There's no redemption
643	for the likes of you.
644	Don't you knock? Even just once?
645	We must go and collect
646	our train tickets for tomorrow now.
647	This way, no last-minute problems.
648	Also, we must buy gifts
649	for everyone in my village.
650	Everyone?
651	Help me! Help me!
652	– This is not our business, Lin.
653	– Let's go. Lin!
654	– Please. Help me.
655	– Let me see. Let me see.
656	– When was the last time he shot?
657	– He's dying!
658	– When was the last time?
659	– I don't know.
660	– Give me some room.
661	– Somebody call the police.
662	Lin, this is not our problem.
663	It is very bad business.
664	– When did he last shoot?
665	– It is best we are not involved!
666	– Lin, let's go!
667	– An hour? I don't know.
668	Lin, the police are coming!
669	No! Come back! Come back!
670	You know, I could've saved him.
671	I've treated overdoses before.
672	Where are you taking him?
673	I don't know, Linbaba.
674	He was looking pretty dead to me.
675	I could have fucking tried.
676	It's nothing to do with me.
677	– You have to come with us now.
678	– I don't wanna come with you.
679	What's the point, Prabhu,
680	being here, of any of it,
681	if all I am is scared?
682	What is it that you are scared of, Lin?
683	I gotta do something.
684	Hey, Lin,
685	we are leaving tomorrow early, yaar.
686	Look, go get the train tickets.
687	I'll be back here tomorrow.
688	We'll leave as planned.
689	Right now, I gotta be somewhere.
690	– Who is it?
691	– It's me. Lin.
692	– I'll do it.
693	– What?
694	Lisa.
695	If we can go tonight, I'll do it.
696	Either way, I'm leaving Bombay
697	first thing tomorrow morning.
698	What changed?
699	Come here.
700	Choose something smart.
701	You've got a lot of men's clothes.
702	The last two guys
703	who lived here left suddenly.
704	And didn't take their gear?
705	One of them was breaking the law.
706	He had to leave in a hurry.
707	I'll leave you to it.
708	Fits you well.
709	So what happened
710	to the other guy who lived here?
711	He died.
712	Whose suit is this?
713	The bad guy, or the dead guy?
714	I bought it for Ahmed to be buried in.
715	In the end, we didn't use it.
716	Fuck me, Karla.
717	Don't tell me you're superstitious.
718	A man like you?
719	What does that mean? A man like me?
720	I don't know. Isn't that the point?
721	Who do you report to?
722	Counselor
723	for Political Affairs, Arlen Hayes.
724	Your hometown?
725	Donald... Donald Gable.
726	Rumor is, Zhou is the former mistress
727	of a KGB officer.
728	But people say
729	a lot of weird stuff about her.
730	Bottom line, she is smart,
731	vindictive and dangerous.
732	Lisa wouldn't be the first girl
733	to disappear from the Palace.
734	How do you know so much about her?
735	I get paid to make deals happen.
736	Some of them happened here.
737	Fuck me.
738	Ram ram, Miss Karla.
739	Padma.
740	Sir, if you please, your business card.
741	Mr. Parker. Karla knows the way.
742	Ready?
743	Is this your American?
744	Gilbert Parker, with the American Embassy.
745	This is not an official visit.
746	At least not this time, anyway.
747	– You are here doing a favor?
748	– Yes.
749	– For you.
750	– I don't think so.
751	Are you in love, Mr. Parker?
752	– What?
753	– I fear you are in love with our Karla.
754	Is that how she got you to do
755	this little job of work for her?
756	I'm here because I was told an American
757	citizen is being held against her will.
758	Don't think for a minute
759	that Karla will ever love you in return.
760	I tell you this, Mr. Parker,
761	as my favor to you.
762	Duly noted. Now, where's Lisa Carter?
763	Mmm. Lisa is where she is happy to be.
764	Well, then bring her out
765	and let her tell me that herself.
766	I don't think so.
767	Let's go. This is a waste of time.
768	Your business is with me, not her.
769	You don't look or talk
770	much like a diplomat.
771	No. No, I work out of the embassy.
772	Nobody said I was a diplomat.
773	My department tends to be
774	a little more hands-on.
775	Parker.
776	So you should get me Lisa Carter.
777	Because if you fuck with me
778	for one minute longer,
779	I will have agents camped
780	on your doorstep,
781	taking photographs
782	of anyone coming in or out.
783	And I'll make it clear
784	to the authorities here in Bombay
785	that the Palace and the US government
786	are now at war.
787	Quite the dog you bring
788	in here on a leash, Karla.
789	Is this about Ahmed and Christina?
790	Nothing you do will change
791	the fact they are gone.
792	If I walk out of here alone,
793	there's no going back.
794	I agree to your terms, Mr. Parker.
795	You can take Lisa with you.
796	I just wonder if Karla will keep her end
797	of whatever bargain you made.
798	She's really letting me go?
799	Mr. Parker here and Madame Zhou
800	came to an agreement.
801	Then I guess
802	I should be thanking Mr. Parker.
803	Let's get the fuck out of here
804	before she changes her mind.
805	What the hell were you thinking,
806	going after her like that?
807	I need a fix, Karla.
808	Zhou cut me off
809	unless I told you I wanted to stay.
810	But I knew once you got my message,
811	you'd come running.
812	Come here.
813	I'm ready.
814	I'll quit.
815	I just have to level off.
816	Give me the name.
817	Rujul.
818	The man I saw was Rujul Aadekar.
819	It's gonna be okay.
820	Wait!
821	Lin, stop! Come on!
822	Please.
823	Why? So you can feed me more bullshit
824	about Madame Zhou
825	and whatever history you and her have got?
826	You know, I heard her say
827	that dead guy's name, Ahmed,
828	the guy whose suit I was wearing.
829	– I didn't sign up to feed anyone's habit.
830	– There's more if you want it.
831	Fuck you.
832	You know, I heard Lisa in there.
833	You got her out
834	so she could give you some name.
835	Wasn't to rescue her.
836	And I wonder what you're so guilty about
837	that playing the hero was this important.
838	So this was all just some shit you fed me
839	'cause you knew I'd bite?
840	We all have secrets, Lin.
841	I don't wanna know yours because
842	I have no intention of telling you mine.
843	But you're right.
844	I got Lisa out for my own reasons.
845	But that doesn't change the good you did.
846	Don't confuse the two.
847	I hope you find what you need.
848	I felt like I'd been dropped
849	straight into deep, dark water.
850	Everything exploding around me.
851	I am number one guide in Bombay.
852	I know everything there is to know...
853	...touching everyone,
854	friends and enemies...
855	changing everyone's lives forever.
