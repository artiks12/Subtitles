1	We have to decide how we're
2	going to kill this bitch.
3	I know Fami's death
4	affected you deeply.
5	It hurt us all.
6	We can figure it out when
7	we get to the compound.
8	Let's kill her, record it and
9	see if that makes an impact.
10	Let's do it now!
11	Let's go!
12	Vámonos.
13	Go.
14	A little step. One more.
15	Go.
16	I got Amber!
17	Relax.
18	You made the right
19	decision not to kill her.
20	Let her rot in there.
21	It's worse than death.
22	We know where they
23	are taking her.
24	A cocaine place full
25	of Venezuelan army.
26	They killed my men.
27	They have to be
28	punished, and they will.
29	But the General is right.
30	We cannot engage on
31	this side of the border.
32	Attacking a facility on
33	this side of the border,
34	so closely tied to the
35	Venezuelan government,
36	would be seen as an act of war.
37	As Colombian Army, this is
38	as far as we can go for now.
39	It's time to go home and
40	face the politicians.
41	Let's go.
42	I'm staying.
43	By yourself? That's
44	not a good idea.
45	I can't go back without
46	her. You know that.
47	Good luck.
48	Thank you.
49	Rápido.
50	I had her, Dad.
51	In my arms. So close.
52	I could feel her
53	breathing on my back.
54	I can imagine.
55	She's brilliant.
56	She's the purest
57	soul I ever met.
58	She's a liar.
59	She is a liar.
60	That's a big lie,
61	working for the CIA.
62	It's not like, you know, lying
63	about some old boyfriend's big dick.
64	I don't know how you trust that.
65	Reminds me of the...
66	wisdom of one of my
67	mentors, Kenny Rogers.
68	You got to know when to hold 'em
69	Know when to fold 'em
70	Know when to walk away
71	Know when to run.
72	Come on.
73	Go on.
74	Yeah.
75	I'm in pain too, but
76	instead of thinking of that,
77	all you can do is revert
78	to your redneck loyalty.
79	You promised me when we got
80	married you wouldn't do this shit.
81	She's got a side thing she's
82	doing for the Agency down there.
83	Special status.
84	I've been all around the world.
85	You guys are both fucking liars.
86	They could hold her for 20 years
87	or they could kill her tomorrow.
88	You gotta know when to hold
89	'em Know when to fold 'em
90	Know when to walk away
91	Know when to run.
92	All right, talk to me.
93	So the book on that place
94	says it's like FedEx for the Venezuelan
95	drug cartel run by the military.
96	It's called Cartel de los
97	Soles, the Cartel of Suns,
98	which, if you
99	didn't already know,
100	is run all the way to the top
101	of the Venezuelan government.
102	Security is strong.
103	That's army on the outside if
104	you haven't already noticed.
105	Also, I feel the need to point out
106	that that's where they pay out ELN,
107	so there's gonna be
108	guerrillas hanging around.
109	– Blah, blah, blah.
110	– Those guys are no joke.
111	I can knock it over
112	in a couple of months.
113	How? There's no support within
114	the administration on this.
115	The White House doesn't
116	even wanna hear about her.
117	They won't engage, no
118	matter what any of us do.
119	So, what about Ground Branch?
120	No appetite. It's gonna sound harsh, man,
121	but not every problem has a solution.
122	I'll tell you another
123	problem without a solution.
124	When you wake up one morning
125	with a Glock in your mouth.
126	You notice I said
127	“Glock,” not “cock?”
128	And let me tell you,
129	it won't feel good when that bullet opens
130	up your fucking skull like a watermelon.
131	That would be very
132	traumatizing for my husband.
133	– Oh, yeah.
134	– Listen, I'm not giving up.
135	Seventh floor is aware and concerned,
136	but for the moment, you're on your own.
137	Shall we order in tonight?
138	Cleaned up enough
139	messes for one day.
140	Talk to me.
141	It's Amber.
142	They're forcing me to
143	bury her. Bambi too.
144	What? What do you
145	mean? Where is she?
146	In some Venezuelan
147	hellhole. A drug facility.
148	He's wandering around
149	like a lost dog.
150	Well, you can't do that.
151	Amber's our friend.
152	And Bambi, Jesus Christ,
153	Mitch, he saved your life.
154	I mean, you gotta
155	get him outta there.
156	Come on. It's not
157	some eternal debt.
158	Pretty sure he can take care
159	of himself. He's fucking Rambo.
160	She knew the risks. It's
161	what she signed up for.
162	You've known her for 15 years. Amber's
163	not just a friend. She's family.
164	I'm just as upset
165	about this as you are.
166	There's nothing I can do, David.
167	Is everybody in your
168	life just an asset?
169	Am I?
170	Look, I have a job, and my job is
171	to consider the biggest picture.
172	And in the big picture,
173	it's easier if she stays.
174	I'm sorry to say it, but it is.
175	The longer she stays in that prison, the
176	clearer it becomes how awful Maduro is
177	when it comes to human rights!
178	And you're being a
179	careerist weasel!
180	Wow. Must be nice to be able
181	to take the moral high ground?
182	Make you feel all
183	warm and cozy inside.
184	You know, I'd love to be up there too,
185	but unfortunately, I took an oath.
186	Yeah. I know all about it.
187	No, no. You'll listen.
188	The oath I took for my job?
189	What was it? Let's see.
190	Hard to remember. Oh, yeah.
191	Defend this country against all
192	enemies, foreign and domestic.
193	Bear true faith and
194	allegiance to the same.
195	I take this obligation freely,
196	without any mental reservation, et
197	cetera, et cetera, so help me, God.
198	It doesn't say jack shit in
199	there about being a good person.
200	Now I don't want you to get the
201	wrong idea about me or nothing,
202	but...
203	I'm not a drunk.
204	It's okay. Jesus doesn't judge.
205	I've saved some people.
206	Lot of people owe their lives.
207	And they like me.
208	Are you DEA?
209	Do I look like I give
210	a shit about cocaine?
211	I was a soldier.
212	– A soldier?
213	– Long time ago.
214	What do you do now?
215	I'm in tourism.
216	People wanna see the
217	authentic Colombia.
218	For the sunsets.
219	Landscapes.
220	You know, people, they
221	look at this forest
222	and they go, “How
223	beautiful.” “How beautiful?”
224	I just see trees and plants, all
225	fighting each other for the sunlight.
226	All of them just racing
227	to the top of the canopy.
228	And then the slow
229	growers, they just...
230	die in the shade.
231	“Let not your hearts be troubled.
232	Neither let them be afraid.”
233	That's John. Right?
234	Anyway, it was somewhere, but...
235	You're a believer.
236	That's great.
237	Well, God or the Devil.
238	Depends which side
239	of the gun you're on.
240	You're gonna fucking learn!
241	I don't know.
242	I've killed too
243	many men in my life.
244	Stay fucking down!
245	I've told you about
246	wearing those shorts!
247	Shut up!
248	Stay the fuck down!
249	See what I'm saying?
250	I was eight. You know?
251	You know what?
252	I'm a pretty good shot.
253	Wanna know the
254	secret? Repeatability.
255	You gotta hold the weapon the
256	exact same way every time.
257	Fuck it, you're gonna learn now!
258	You're gonna fucking learn...
259	Yes.
260	You're a protector.
261	Your family must be
262	really happy to have you.
263	Let's sleep together.
264	I should make you a hamburger.
265	You know what?
266	I should've played baseball.
267	I had a 72-mile-an-hour
268	fastball when I was 14.
269	That's really good, by the way.
270	Finish outside.
271	Go. Go play baseball outside.
272	Finally.
273	How did I get here?
274	I found you in the street.
275	Well, thank you for rescuing me.
276	I didn't think I'd made such
277	a good first impression.
278	You hungry?
279	It's...
280	From my cousin, Javi.
281	He's a fisherman.
282	“Follow me and I will
283	make you fishers of men.”
284	Where does he get so much fish?
285	Next to the bridge, where
286	the current slows down.
287	By the big bridge?
288	Yes, but you can't go there.
289	Fishermen are very
290	territorial, especially Javi.
291	Buenos días.
292	Buenos días.
293	This is where I fish, my friend.
294	You want me to swim over to the
295	other side and fish from Venezuela?
296	That's not my problem, man.
297	Aren't rivers for everyone?
298	This is where the
299	currents converge.
300	A man must fish
301	where the fish are.
302	A man has to be careful.
303	This is my spot.
304	Well, how about you take
305	all the fish that I get,
306	and you just give
307	me ten dollars?
308	What's your name?
309	Javi.
310	Me llamo Bambi.
311	It's funny, right?
312	I'm gonna make you rich.
313	Rich? How?
314	– How?
315	– Yeah.
316	With money.
317	Good.
318	– See you tomorrow.
319	– Mañana.
320	Mañana, amigo.
321	Okay.
322	Do you know what?
323	– What? Tell me.
324	– Cumbia is the best music in the world.
325	Look at this.
326	– Salud.
327	– Good. Good job.
328	Let's have beer.
329	We got five million in the
330	campaign exploratory account.
331	That's ten times what
332	anybody else has.
333	We got some heavy hitters coming
334	in. Lot of White House experience.
335	You're gonna have
336	big guns behind you.
337	Right. Good.
338	What's the matter? Your
339	head still in Colombia?
340	I know you gotta
341	be torn up inside.
342	Let's not do that.
343	– What?
344	– Talk about emotion.
345	Okay, tough guy.
346	But you need to understand
347	she is not coming out. Ever.
348	We did the research.
349	I spoke to the White House.
350	It is very sad. I liked her a
351	lot, but she is not coming home.
352	Well, now it's time to move
353	to the grown-ups' table
354	and make some decisions about your life
355	before life makes the decisions for you.
356	I'll do my best
357	to make you happy.
358	Christ.
359	When did you get so cynical?
360	I don't know. Maybe at Harvard.
361	It's fine. I just
362	wanted to be clear.
363	No, maybe you're right.
364	Maybe everybody's just, you know,
365	operating out of self-interest.
366	Maybe family is just some...
367	sentimental construct to justify
368	some heartless animal kingdom crap.
369	Maybe real love doesn't exist at
370	all, but I want you to remember,
371	I taught you how to
372	wipe your own ass.
373	I had your shit on my fingers.
374	And if you think that wasn't out of
375	love, you need to grow the fuck up.
376	Cynicism is a refuge for
377	the young and the childless.
378	Too much?
379	No.
380	Senator, I hope we
381	didn't keep you waiting.
382	Outside of the development team,
383	you're gonna be the
384	first to know about this.
385	– If you don't like it, I'll be devastated.
386	– Well, it's not up to me.
387	Let's see where the warfighters
388	put it on their list of priorities.
389	Speaking of which, we
390	have one right here.
391	I wasn't expecting to see you.
392	We're all very sorry for your loss.
393	Thank you.
394	My father... dad, does not
395	know what I'm about to say.
396	I'm intrigued.
397	I've been exploring a run for
398	the Senate seat opening up.
399	Could we talk
400	about your support?
401	I would love to talk
402	to you about it.
403	That's how you make history,
404	kids. Got a future president here.
405	Senator, I know
406	your time is short.
407	Reese, wanna kick it off?
408	Senator, may we
409	introduce you to Ulysses?
410	You feel it in your bones.
411	When that call comes in,
412	it's the tone of voice,
413	and you know something
414	bad has happened.
415	When you hear, “Your
416	wife has been kidnapped.”
417	And it has shattered your core,
418	and makes you mad at God, and
419	you say, “How can God be good?”
420	And then you segue.
421	People like vulnerability.
422	And you take the lessons
423	that life has given you.
424	Everybody has loss.
425	Some people's loss
426	is worse than yours.
427	I think about a woman who's lost her
428	child because of substandard medical care,
429	and I know that I
430	wanna fight her fight.
431	And along with that is the importance
432	of stronger national security.
433	Americans should be free to travel
434	safely all around the globe.
435	And when anyone threatens that,
436	they should fear our wrath.
437	Make it your own, of course,
438	but something like that.
439	Hey, Boss. You got a sec?
440	Got a confession to make.
441	You got five minutes.
442	So, our hero gets picked up by
443	jungle bros we know are ELN.
444	Okay, you can assume
445	I paid attention.
446	Right. They drop her off in this
447	facility run by the Venezuelan military.
448	That suggests to me they
449	consider her a keeper.
450	Chit for sanctions, propaganda.
451	Maybe they don't know yet.
452	So, what's your confession?
453	Well, Amber's been good to the Agency,
454	and I'm personally tight with her brother.
455	He's done a lot of
456	favors for us in Iraq.
457	On the one hand, we have loyalty
458	and our integrity as human beings.
459	On the other hand, the price of
460	loyalty, in this case, is very high.
461	So there's an upside to
462	cutting ties right now.
463	But I still don't see
464	how it's my problem.
465	Well, I'm trying one last idea.
466	We could help Bambi
467	knock the place over.
468	Don't put any of
469	this on my desk.
470	Hey.
471	It's not a good time.
472	You're scared. It's cool.
473	Can I be rough?
474	I don't know, can you?
475	Is it “yes,” or is it “no?”
476	Yeah.
477	I changed my mind.
478	What the fuck are we
479	doing? This is bullshit.
480	It's not.
481	I was pretty clear
482	about my motivations.
483	You're going through a lot 'cause
484	you're injured and your wife's in hell,
485	and that, I'm here to be the
486	companion in the hard times.
487	Well, thank you,
488	but I don't need it.
489	And I don't want it.
490	What about me? What
491	about what I want?
492	– You're so handsome.
493	– Jesus.
494	– Do you always do that?
495	– What?
496	Just push away compliments?
497	When they spring from
498	ulterior motives, yeah.
499	Handsome but so sensitive.
500	Trust me, nobody
501	has ever said that.
502	Well, maybe the people in your life
503	don't really see you for who you are.
504	I'm an outside observer here,
505	but yeah, you're sensitive,
506	and you're just trying
507	really hard not to show it.
508	Come on. Empathy.
509	Psychological insight.
510	And now I'm literally
511	on my knees for you.
512	You have to admit, it's
513	a pretty strong offer.
