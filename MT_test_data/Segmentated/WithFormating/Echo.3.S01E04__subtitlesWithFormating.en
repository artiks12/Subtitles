1-2	We have to decide how we're going to kill this bitch.
3-4	I know Fami's death affected you deeply.
5-5	It hurt us all.
6-7	We can figure it out when we get to the compound.
8-9	Let's kill her, record it and see if that makes an impact.
10-10	Let's do it now!
11-11	Let's go!
12-12	Vámonos.
13-13	Go.
14-14	A little step. One more.
15-15	Go.
16-16	I got Amber!
17-17	Relax.
18-19	You made the right decision not to kill her.
20-21	Let her rot in there. It's worse than death.
22-23	We know where they are taking her.
24-25	A cocaine place full of Venezuelan army.
26-26	They killed my men.
27-28	They have to be punished, and they will.
29-29	But the General is right.
30-31	We cannot engage on this side of the border.
32-33	Attacking a facility on this side of the border,
34-35	so closely tied to the Venezuelan government,
36-36	would be seen as an act of war.
37-38	As Colombian Army, this is as far as we can go for now.
39-40	It's time to go home and face the politicians.
41-41	Let's go.
42-42	I'm staying.
43-44	By yourself? That's not a good idea.
45-46	I can't go back without her. You know that.
47-47	Good luck.
48-48	Thank you.
49-49	Rápido.
50-50	I had her, Dad.
51-51	In my arms. So close.
52-53	I could feel her breathing on my back.
54-54	I can imagine.
55-55	She's brilliant.
56-57	She's the purest soul I ever met.
58-58	She's a liar.
59-59	She is a liar.
60-61	That's a big lie, working for the CIA.
62-63	It's not like, you know, lying about some old boyfriend's big dick.
64-64	I don't know how you trust that.
65-65	Reminds me of the...
66-67	wisdom of one of my mentors, Kenny Rogers.
68-68	You got to know when to hold 'em
69-69	Know when to fold 'em
70-70	Know when to walk away
71-71	Know when to run.
72-72	Come on.
73-73	Go on.
74-74	Yeah.
75-76	I'm in pain too, but instead of thinking of that,
77-78	all you can do is revert to your redneck loyalty.
79-80	You promised me when we got married you wouldn't do this shit.
81-82	She's got a side thing she's doing for the Agency down there.
83-83	Special status.
84-84	I've been all around the world.
85-85	You guys are both fucking liars.
86-87	They could hold her for 20 years or they could kill her tomorrow.
88-89	You gotta know when to hold 'em Know when to fold 'em
90-90	Know when to walk away
91-91	Know when to run.
92-92	All right, talk to me.
93-93	So the book on that place
94-95	says it's like FedEx for the Venezuelan drug cartel run by the military.
96-97	It's called Cartel de los Soles, the Cartel of Suns,
98-99	which, if you didn't already know,
100-101	is run all the way to the top of the Venezuelan government.
102-102	Security is strong.
103-104	That's army on the outside if you haven't already noticed.
105-106	Also, I feel the need to point out that that's where they pay out ELN,
107-108	so there's gonna be guerrillas hanging around.
109-109	– Blah, blah, blah.
110-110	– Those guys are no joke.
111-112	I can knock it over in a couple of months.
113-114	How? There's no support within the administration on this.
115-116	The White House doesn't even wanna hear about her.
117-118	They won't engage, no matter what any of us do.
119-119	So, what about Ground Branch?
120-121	No appetite. It's gonna sound harsh, man, but not every problem has a solution.
122-123	I'll tell you another problem without a solution.
124-125	When you wake up one morning with a Glock in your mouth.
126-127	You notice I said “Glock,” not “cock?”
128-128	And let me tell you,
129-130	it won't feel good when that bullet opens up your fucking skull like a watermelon.
131-132	That would be very traumatizing for my husband.
133-133	– Oh, yeah.
134-134	– Listen, I'm not giving up.
135-136	Seventh floor is aware and concerned, but for the moment, you're on your own.
137-137	Shall we order in tonight?
138-139	Cleaned up enough messes for one day.
140-140	Talk to me.
141-141	It's Amber.
142-143	They're forcing me to bury her. Bambi too.
144-145	What? What do you mean? Where is she?
146-147	In some Venezuelan hellhole. A drug facility.
148-149	He's wandering around like a lost dog.
150-150	Well, you can't do that.
151-151	Amber's our friend.
152-153	And Bambi, Jesus Christ, Mitch, he saved your life.
154-155	I mean, you gotta get him outta there.
156-157	Come on. It's not some eternal debt.
158-159	Pretty sure he can take care of himself. He's fucking Rambo.
160-161	She knew the risks. It's what she signed up for.
162-163	You've known her for 15 years. Amber's not just a friend. She's family.
164-165	I'm just as upset about this as you are.
166-166	There's nothing I can do, David.
167-168	Is everybody in your life just an asset?
169-169	Am I?
170-171	Look, I have a job, and my job is to consider the biggest picture.
172-173	And in the big picture, it's easier if she stays.
174-174	I'm sorry to say it, but it is.
175-176	The longer she stays in that prison, the clearer it becomes how awful Maduro is
177-177	when it comes to human rights!
178-179	And you're being a careerist weasel!
180-181	Wow. Must be nice to be able to take the moral high ground?
182-183	Make you feel all warm and cozy inside.
184-185	You know, I'd love to be up there too, but unfortunately, I took an oath.
186-186	Yeah. I know all about it.
187-187	No, no. You'll listen.
188-188	The oath I took for my job?
189-190	What was it? Let's see. Hard to remember. Oh, yeah.
191-192	Defend this country against all enemies, foreign and domestic.
193-194	Bear true faith and allegiance to the same.
195-195	I take this obligation freely,
196-197	without any mental reservation, et cetera, et cetera, so help me, God.
198-199	It doesn't say jack shit in there about being a good person.
200-201	Now I don't want you to get the wrong idea about me or nothing,
202-202	but...
203-203	I'm not a drunk.
204-204	It's okay. Jesus doesn't judge.
205-205	I've saved some people.
206-206	Lot of people owe their lives.
207-207	And they like me.
208-208	Are you DEA?
209-210	Do I look like I give a shit about cocaine?
211-211	I was a soldier.
212-212	– A soldier?
213-213	– Long time ago.
214-214	What do you do now?
215-215	I'm in tourism.
216-217	People wanna see the authentic Colombia.
218-218	For the sunsets.
219-219	Landscapes.
220-221	You know, people, they look at this forest
222-223	and they go, “How beautiful.” “How beautiful?”
224-225	I just see trees and plants, all fighting each other for the sunlight.
226-227	All of them just racing to the top of the canopy.
228-229	And then the slow growers, they just...
230-230	die in the shade.
231-232	“Let not your hearts be troubled. Neither let them be afraid.”
233-233	That's John. Right?
234-234	Anyway, it was somewhere, but...
235-235	You're a believer.
236-236	That's great.
237-237	Well, God or the Devil.
238-239	Depends which side of the gun you're on.
240-240	You're gonna fucking learn!
241-241	I don't know.
242-243	I've killed too many men in my life.
244-244	Stay fucking down!
245-246	I've told you about wearing those shorts!
247-247	Shut up!
248-248	Stay the fuck down!
249-249	See what I'm saying?
250-250	I was eight. You know?
251-251	You know what?
252-252	I'm a pretty good shot.
253-254	Wanna know the secret? Repeatability.
255-256	You gotta hold the weapon the exact same way every time.
257-257	Fuck it, you're gonna learn now!
258-258	You're gonna fucking learn...
259-259	Yes.
260-260	You're a protector.
261-262	Your family must be really happy to have you.
263-263	Let's sleep together.
264-264	I should make you a hamburger.
265-265	You know what?
266-266	I should've played baseball.
267-268	I had a 72-mile-an-hour fastball when I was 14.
269-269	That's really good, by the way.
270-270	Finish outside.
271-271	Go. Go play baseball outside.
272-272	Finally.
273-273	How did I get here?
274-274	I found you in the street.
275-275	Well, thank you for rescuing me.
276-277	I didn't think I'd made such a good first impression.
278-278	You hungry?
279-279	It's...
280-281	From my cousin, Javi. He's a fisherman.
282-283	“Follow me and I will make you fishers of men.”
284-284	Where does he get so much fish?
285-286	Next to the bridge, where the current slows down.
287-287	By the big bridge?
288-288	Yes, but you can't go there.
289-290	Fishermen are very territorial, especially Javi.
291-291	Buenos días.
292-292	Buenos días.
293-293	This is where I fish, my friend.
294-295	You want me to swim over to the other side and fish from Venezuela?
296-296	That's not my problem, man.
297-297	Aren't rivers for everyone?
298-299	This is where the currents converge.
300-301	A man must fish where the fish are.
302-302	A man has to be careful.
303-303	This is my spot.
304-305	Well, how about you take all the fish that I get,
306-307	and you just give me ten dollars?
308-308	What's your name?
309-309	Javi.
310-310	Me llamo Bambi.
311-311	It's funny, right?
312-312	I'm gonna make you rich.
313-313	Rich? How?
314-314	– How?
315-315	– Yeah.
316-316	With money.
317-317	Good.
318-318	– See you tomorrow.
319-319	– Mañana.
320-320	Mañana, amigo.
321-321	Okay.
322-322	Do you know what?
323-323	– What? Tell me.
324-324	– Cumbia is the best music in the world.
325-325	Look at this.
326-326	– Salud.
327-327	– Good. Good job.
328-328	Let's have beer.
329-330	We got five million in the campaign exploratory account.
331-332	That's ten times what anybody else has.
333-334	We got some heavy hitters coming in. Lot of White House experience.
335-336	You're gonna have big guns behind you.
337-337	Right. Good.
338-339	What's the matter? Your head still in Colombia?
340-341	I know you gotta be torn up inside.
342-342	Let's not do that.
343-343	– What?
344-344	– Talk about emotion.
345-345	Okay, tough guy.
346-347	But you need to understand she is not coming out. Ever.
348-348	We did the research.
349-349	I spoke to the White House.
350-351	It is very sad. I liked her a lot, but she is not coming home.
352-353	Well, now it's time to move to the grown-ups' table
354-355	and make some decisions about your life before life makes the decisions for you.
356-357	I'll do my best to make you happy.
358-358	Christ.
359-359	When did you get so cynical?
360-360	I don't know. Maybe at Harvard.
361-362	It's fine. I just wanted to be clear.
363-363	No, maybe you're right.
364-365	Maybe everybody's just, you know, operating out of self-interest.
366-366	Maybe family is just some...
367-368	sentimental construct to justify some heartless animal kingdom crap.
369-370	Maybe real love doesn't exist at all, but I want you to remember,
371-372	I taught you how to wipe your own ass.
373-373	I had your shit on my fingers.
374-375	And if you think that wasn't out of love, you need to grow the fuck up.
376-377	Cynicism is a refuge for the young and the childless.
378-378	Too much?
379-379	No.
380-381	Senator, I hope we didn't keep you waiting.
382-382	Outside of the development team,
383-384	you're gonna be the first to know about this.
385-385	– If you don't like it, I'll be devastated.
386-386	– Well, it's not up to me.
387-388	Let's see where the warfighters put it on their list of priorities.
389-390	Speaking of which, we have one right here.
391-392	I wasn't expecting to see you. We're all very sorry for your loss.
393-393	Thank you.
394-395	My father... dad, does not know what I'm about to say.
396-396	I'm intrigued.
397-398	I've been exploring a run for the Senate seat opening up.
399-400	Could we talk about your support?
401-402	I would love to talk to you about it.
403-404	That's how you make history, kids. Got a future president here.
405-406	Senator, I know your time is short.
407-407	Reese, wanna kick it off?
408-409	Senator, may we introduce you to Ulysses?
410-410	You feel it in your bones.
411-412	When that call comes in, it's the tone of voice,
413-414	and you know something bad has happened.
415-416	When you hear, “Your wife has been kidnapped.”
417-417	And it has shattered your core,
418-419	and makes you mad at God, and you say, “How can God be good?”
420-421	And then you segue. People like vulnerability.
422-423	And you take the lessons that life has given you.
424-424	Everybody has loss.
425-426	Some people's loss is worse than yours.
427-428	I think about a woman who's lost her child because of substandard medical care,
429-430	and I know that I wanna fight her fight.
431-432	And along with that is the importance of stronger national security.
433-434	Americans should be free to travel safely all around the globe.
435-436	And when anyone threatens that, they should fear our wrath.
437-438	Make it your own, of course, but something like that.
439-439	Hey, Boss. You got a sec?
440-440	Got a confession to make.
441-441	You got five minutes.
442-443	So, our hero gets picked up by jungle bros we know are ELN.
444-445	Okay, you can assume I paid attention.
446-447	Right. They drop her off in this facility run by the Venezuelan military.
448-449	That suggests to me they consider her a keeper.
450-451	Chit for sanctions, propaganda. Maybe they don't know yet.
452-452	So, what's your confession?
453-454	Well, Amber's been good to the Agency, and I'm personally tight with her brother.
455-456	He's done a lot of favors for us in Iraq.
457-458	On the one hand, we have loyalty and our integrity as human beings.
459-460	On the other hand, the price of loyalty, in this case, is very high.
461-462	So there's an upside to cutting ties right now.
463-464	But I still don't see how it's my problem.
465-465	Well, I'm trying one last idea.
466-467	We could help Bambi knock the place over.
468-469	Don't put any of this on my desk.
470-470	Hey.
471-471	It's not a good time.
472-472	You're scared. It's cool.
473-473	Can I be rough?
474-474	I don't know, can you?
475-475	Is it “yes,” or is it “no?”
476-476	Yeah.
477-477	I changed my mind.
478-479	What the fuck are we doing? This is bullshit.
480-480	It's not.
481-482	I was pretty clear about my motivations.
483-484	You're going through a lot 'cause you're injured and your wife's in hell,
485-486	and that, I'm here to be the companion in the hard times.
487-488	Well, thank you, but I don't need it.
489-489	And I don't want it.
490-491	What about me? What about what I want?
492-492	– You're so handsome.
493-493	– Jesus.
494-494	– Do you always do that?
495-495	– What?
496-496	Just push away compliments?
497-498	When they spring from ulterior motives, yeah.
499-499	Handsome but so sensitive.
500-501	Trust me, nobody has ever said that.
502-503	Well, maybe the people in your life don't really see you for who you are.
504-505	I'm an outside observer here, but yeah, you're sensitive,
506-507	and you're just trying really hard not to show it.
508-509	Come on. Empathy. Psychological insight.
510-511	And now I'm literally on my knees for you.
512-513	You have to admit, it's a pretty strong offer.
