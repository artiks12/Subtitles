1	This is to tie it up.
2	Oh, no! And what happened there?
3	It's weird she hasn't called.
4	You'd call us if Donal
5	didn't come home one night, right?
6	Don't know. Would I?
7	She'll probably call the police first,
8	right?
9	Are you not talking to me?
10	I am talking to you. I'm still processing.
11	You shouldn't have let her go rogue.
12	Now she's got to
13	carry that burden of guilt.
14	You weren't concerned about me
15	when I was going to shoot him.
16	Or me.
17	Well, she's younger than...
18	She's practically a kid.
19	She's 29.
20	What's the cutoff age for killing a man?
21	Anyway, we're not a firing squad.
22	We always knew one of us
23	would get the final bullet.
24	Nice.
25	Becka.
26	Wait. Wait. Becka, wait!
27	I can't breathe.
28	There must've been tools in there!
29	Was there tools in there?
30	There's no tools. We checked!
31	What happened?
32	He's unkillable. He's like a cockroach.
33	Someone was in that room!
34	What am I missing?
35	Birthday planning!
36	Get back in there, you big eavesdropper.
37	Get in.
38	Get in!
39	Sorry!
40	I have to go over there.
41	No, wait, wait, wait. What do...
42	Why is he here? He never comes.
43	It doesn't matter.
44	It's good that he's here.
45	We'll keep him here
46	while you check on Minna, okay?
47	Okay, look, walk! Don't run.
48	We're gonna say you're sick.
49	I actually do feel sick.
50	So, Blanaid, did your daddy threaten
51	to cancel your pocket money?
52	Is that what happened?
53	Road rage incident. Very angry chap.
54	Um, got his license number though.
55	Um, JP, why don't you take a seat?
56	No. What? What... Stay.
57	You can, uh, have, uh... have Becka's seat.
58	Oh, yeah.
59	That's a great idea, JP. Stay.
60	No. I just wanted to drop the girls off.
61	I need to bring Mum her shopping.
62	Should've done it last night.
63	Minna!
64	Minna, it's me!
65	Minna!
66	You called Becka.
67	Leave a message, you weirdo.
68	Becka, he's going round there,
69	so just... please...
70	Hey!
71	Will we serve up dessert?
72	Absolutely. Yeah, get stuck in.
73	Everyone's a bit weird today.
74	Are they?
75	Oh, my God.
76	Mama! Where are you?
77	Oh, shit. Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
78	Where are you?
79	I've got some groceries for you.
80	Looks like you'll be eating fish fingers
81	for a few days.
82	Mama!
83	Mama!
84	Where are you?
85	Mama!
86	But Mama, what are you doing?
87	What are you doing, Mama?
88	Oh, you're so cold!
89	I thought you were sick.
90	She's, um... She's sleeping.
91	I'll come in and wait.
92	No.
93	Don't like you hanging around here,
94	giving her ideas.
95	Go away.
96	Ah, fuck!
97	Oh, Becka. Thank Christ!
98	He said she's sleeping.
99	What, you talked to him?
100	I need to know.
101	What did you say to him?
102	Nothing.
103	I just said I fancied a Minna day.
104	I have to get in that house.
105	Look. I know this is awful, not knowing,
106	but forcing your way in there
107	is only going to make things worse.
108	She's right.
109	We just need to act like normal, okay?
110	Wait it out.
111	Go in and lie down.
112	I'll get you a plate of food.
113	I can't eat.
114	Well,
115	then I will bring you a box of wine, okay?
116	Just go and lie down.
117	I can't lie down.
118	Well, just pace about then,
119	but do it here.
120	Not outside Minna's.
121	If Minna's in there...
122	I can't even think about that.
123	I'm saying he might suspect...
124	No. No, it looked like an accident.
125	If she is in there,
126	then he's the one with the problem.
127	What the...
128	What service do you require?
129	I just found my mother
130	unresponsive in bed.
131	When was she last conscious? Do you know?
132	Hello? Excuse me, sir,
133	are you still there?
134	Hey, honey.
135	I'm just here with all the girls.
136	You all right?
137	I'm glad you're together.
138	I... I didn't want Becka to be on her own.
139	Becka, Minna's dead.
140	No. Grace.
141	She passed away last night in her sleep.
142	If there's anything we can do, just...
143	John Paul needs me now. Talk later, okay?
144	Listen. Listen to me!
145	None of this would have happened
146	if the prick hadn't have
147	locked his dead dad in a fucking freezer!
148	She must have known George was in there.
149	She must have gone to see him.
150	I know. Yeah. Yeah.
151	Or maybe she actually died in bed.
152	Christ's sake. He's covering his tracks!
153	No, he can't.
154	He can't get away with this too.
155	I mean, if he's gonna lie about Minna,
156	then I'll tell the truth about George.
157	I'll take him down even...
158	Even if I go down too.
159	No. No, because if you go down,
160	we all go down.
161	Shut up, Ursula!
162	We need to get in there
163	before he moves his body.
164	And... And do what?
165	I... I don't know! Photograph it!
166	And... And then what?
167	We can't go to the police.
168	You do get that, don't you, Becka?
169	I don't want to hear her.
170	Just, please.
171	Okay. Better we have a photograph
172	than no photograph.
173	No.
174	Just so we have something
175	to use against him if we need it.
176	No, it's too risky.
177	Well, I'm going over there
178	with or without you lot.
179	No, I'll... I'll come with you. Okay?
180	What the hell? Where is he?
181	I can't believe this is happening.
182	Becka.
183	I need to get out of here.
184	Okay.
185	What are you doing here?
186	We were just...
187	I wanted to see the...
188	See what?
189	We were just... Becka thought she left some
190	massage equipment here, so we...
191	What? In the freezer room?
192	We didn't go into any freezer room.
193	We... We were just going. Sorry.
194	Becka, I know you were here last night.
195	You pierced her nose.
196	I took it out
197	'cause it made her look cheap.
198	Sorry for your loss.
199	What else would we be doing down there?
200	He knows we know about George.
201	I don't care if he knows.
202	I care that Minna is dead.
203	I-I care that I did it.
204	Yeah, we did it.
205	You didn't even know about it.
206	I started this. We are all guilty.
207	Oh, shit. Does he know that?
208	I mean, does he know that we...
209	Stop talking about him.
210	My heart is gonna break, Eva.
211	I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
212	I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.
213	Becka. B...
214	Becka!
215	You totally went off radar.
216	You didn't tell me you dug up JP's body.
217	So tell me the truth because,
218	um, my brother is losing his mind.
219	Funny enough, Matt,
220	I don't care about your brother.
221	I care about my sister.
222	You're not paying her
223	what she's due. Why's that?
224	Yeah, we were out driving or messing.
225	I was pissed.
226	I made Eva take me to Gabriel's boat.
227	I thought we could have a drink on board.
228	So, you didn't see JP's car?
229	We didn't notice any cars.
230	We were looking at the boats.
231	Why are you asking?
232	And this bullshit friendship with Minna.
233	What was that about?
234	It wasn't a bullshit friendship.
235	I saw the check she made out to you,
236	Becka.
237	The antique check?
238	Did you notice it wasn't cashed?
239	You wouldn't understand anything
240	about that
241	because all you and your brother
242	can think about is money.
243	Coming from the woman who was happy
244	to take a handout from a man she hated.
245	That's not what...
246	Oh, was it a coincidence
247	she died a few weeks before John Paul...
248	Yes, it was a fucking coincidence!
249	Oh, you're a hypocrite, Becka!
250	And you use people.
251	You saw Minna and took an opportunity.
252	You're doing the same with me.
253	You're the hypocrite!
254	You pretended to like me.
255	Minna was my friend, and I miss her!
256	Stop, Becka.
257	I miss her!
258	Stop.
259	I'm sorry.
260	I'm sorry.
261	Hey. Is everything okay?
262	Yeah.
263	Where are you?
264	You're with her.
265	Yeah.
266	You're a fool. She's lying to you.
267	They killed him in Wick low.
268	I can't prove it, but I know they did it.
269	Someone want a little cuddle?
270	Tom? Tom?
271	You have to pay out? Is that what this is?
272	Well, at least it's done. Over.
273	I've been trying so hard.
274	I care about you and having this baby.
275	Look, come here.
276	We can live in a box out the back
277	of a Harvey Norman.
278	I don't give a shit
279	as long as I have you both.
280	Matt's in love with the Garvey girl.
281	Well, I told you that.
282	I'd like a face-to-face
283	with those Garveys.
284	What is she like?
285	Aside from being an accomplice to murder?
286	There's something else, isn't there?
287	If we can't pay the Williams claim,
288	there will be an investigation.
289	Right. And?
290	And...
291	Well, they'll find a mess.
292	What kind of mess?
293	A fraudulent mess.
294	The Williams case was never processed.
295	There was no cover.
296	Dad just took the monthly payments,
297	and he spent them.
298	If there's an investigation,
299	they'll find that
300	and all the other policies
301	that weren't worth the paper
302	they were written on.
303	He embezzled his clients for years,
304	and I've helped to cover it up.
305	Are you talking jail time, Thomas?
306	Sorry for your loss.
307	Don't bring him on us, Eva.
308	Why? It's so much fun.
309	Minna would've hated this.
310	She deserved a proper send-off.
311	Yeah. A dry funeral.
312	She was always half-pissed
313	every time I saw her.
314	She had dementia, Bibi.
315	No, I mean on top of that.
316	This was her favorite.
317	I'll drink to her if no one else will.
318	That's not gonna help, honey.
319	That is rich coming from you.
320	I need a breather from her.
321	Make sure she doesn't do anything stupid.
322	What happened?
323	Doesn't matter.
324	He's calling it a road rage incident.
325	I had a word with him.
326	What did you say?
327	I told him to stay away.
328	And then you hit him?
329	Yes, I hit him.
330	Christ's sake, Ben.
331	Why did you have to fan the flame?
332	Did anyone see you?
333	What do you expect me to do?
334	After what he did to you,
335	the scumbag should be in jail.
336	Show me your hand.
337	You did that for me?
338	I'd do anything for you, Urs.
339	People keep saying it was her time.
340	Well, she had a long life.
341	But she wasn't ready to die.
342	I think your mother died the day
343	you told her that George had left her.
344	All she did was find her way back to him.
345	Hey.
346	Hey. You okay?
347	I'm grand, really.
348	I'm just worried about this man.
349	Mmm.
350	Yeah.
351	Let's get away, Mammy.
352	Go up to the cabin for your birthday.
353	Dust off the quad bike.
354	And she's gonna be spending her birthday
355	with her sisters like she always does.
356	She's my wife, and she spends it with me.
357	Cabin's not ready. It's a building site.
358	Just needs a woman's touch, really.
359	Well, how about you lot
360	join us the next morning,
361	and we could have a half day
362	at the hotel spa?
363	We all got drunk at the bar
364	and then went back to the cabin.
365	We're not doing a rerun
366	of that car crash of a night.
367	No drunken stragglers this time.
368	I'm fine. I'll see you later.
369	Eva.
370	Um, I'll call you. I love you.
371	Oh, okay. I love you. Yeah, do.
372	Becka!
373	You all right, Pebble?
374	Mmm, yeah, we're okay.
375	I'm worried about John Paul and...
376	Grace.
377	Oscar.
378	We are restructuring, Eva.
379	Where formerly, staff came to you
380	to sign off on client accounts,
381	they will now come to me.
382	And that includes you.
383	And you agree to this?
384	JP says there have been
385	some errors of late, um...
386	What, and you believe him?
387	Yes, I believe him, Eva.
388	You've been distracted recently.
389	Not yourself at all, if I'm honest.
390	And there's been complaints.
391	There's been complaints?
392	Well, what exactly...
393	From clients, um,
394	about the smell of drink off you.
395	And not just your breath.
396	You're sweating alcohol, it seems...
397	Which says something.
398	Eva. Eva.
399	Grace will be upset by this,
400	so I hope we can keep it civil
401	for her sake.
402	Because, Eva, I'm not going anywhere.
403	I know Becka was there
404	the night that Minna died,
405	and I wondered,
406	“Why would she want to hurt Minna?”
407	But there's no answer.
408	And then I had this strange memory
409	of seeing her in my bedroom
410	the night I fell into the marina.
411	And I thought, “Ah, come on.
412	Don't be stupid. How could that be?”
413	But here she is again, one more time,
414	in a place where she shouldn't be.
415	And then,
416	I remembered something else this morning.
417	I remembered
418	the Garvey girls are like rats.
419	Where there's one, there's more,
420	which is why you need to poison the nest.
421	Get away from my car,
422	or I will mow you down like roadkill.
423	Okay, sure. No problem. Please.
424	Emergency. Which service?
425	Jesus, that was quick.
426	Yeah, no. Okay. No. We're
427	not doing that. No, no. Okay, we got it.
428	Kept him in the freezer for years.
429	Jesus Christ. That's why she...
430	Sorry!
431	Thank you!
432	I didn't believe her about George, Eva.
433	Okay.
434	She's been sick,
435	so should be the worst of it over.
436	Okay.
437	It was all over the grave though,
438	so you might want to call Father Doyle
439	in the morning.
440	Offer to sluice it out or...
441	Father D... Yeah. No, I will.
442	I-I'll do that. Yeah.
443	They're not listening to me!
444	Tell them I killed Minna.
445	I'll kill you in a second.
446	Hey, do you know, if you have
447	any Dioralyte at home, that'll help.
448	Brilliant idea. Thank you.
449	Nice house!
450	Thank you.
451	Tell them!
452	Please shut up.
453	Oh, my God.
454	I can't believe she spoke to the police.
455	Just calm down. It was two local morons.
456	She's a liability.
457	I told you this is what would happen
458	if you involved her, didn't I?
459	I am fucking here, you know.
460	Look, I know this is hard,
461	okay, but you are just gonna
462	have to find a way to carry it.
463	That's easy for you to say.
464	He didn't take your eye or blackmail you.
465	Put blood on your hands.
466	Sorry. I know what he did to you.
467	Gabriel and your work.
468	That euthanasia drug
469	that you were telling us about.
470	Can you get that at the hospital?
471	What the hell, Eva?
472	No, I'm gonna finish this.
473	I'm gonna do it this weekend in Wick low.
474	No. No.
475	We are going there
476	to give Grace a decent birthday.
477	What he said to me at work,
478	that was a threat.
479	He is onto us now.
480	He's onto us?
481	Well, what exactly does he know?
482	It's what he suspects.
483	Which is what?
484	That Becka had something
485	to do with Minna's death,
486	or that we're trying to kill him?
487	I don't know.
488	All of it.
489	Can you get it?
490	Pentobarbital? Not from work, no.
491	It's too dangerous to rush into it like
492	this. You're being completely reckless.
493	You're the one who wanted him dead
494	in the first place.
495	I could do it.
496	I've got blood on my hands anyway.
497	Might as well be hung for a sheep.
498	No one's getting hung.
499	This is mine.
500	I can do this. I know I can.
501	Is that a fact?
502	'Cause right now, I think you are more
503	of a liability than she is.
504	We are not doing it.
505	Get the stuff.
506	I'll be back in an hour.
507	Don't look so worried.
508	I won't tell him anything.
509	I just want to suss out the legalities.
510	No point in having a solicitor for a pal
511	if you don't use them, right?
512	You don't have pals.
513	That's true.
514	I love you, Thomas.
515	I know.
516	No.
517	Gotcha, Becka Garvey.
518	Forgot me bloody wallet.
519	Figured I'd have to buy him a drink
520	at least or-or something.
521	Theresa.
522	Theresa! Theresa!
523	Theresa, you okay? Can you hear me?
524	Fuck!
525	You're all right. You're all right.
526	What service do you require?
527	Hello? I need an ambulance!
528	I felt a bit weird
529	picking out knickers for Theresa,
530	Hey. Hey, wait. Thomas. What's going on?
531	She had a seizure.
532	What?
533	I just had some 23-year-old
534	with the emotional depth of a Chihuahua
535	lay it out for me.
536	I could lose her. I could lose my baby.
537	I could lose them both.
538	No, it won't...
539	You won't lose them, Thomas.
540	She was going to see Becka Garvey.
541	Did you know that?
542	That's what she was doing
543	before she collapsed.
544	This is my fault.
545	I dumped all this shite
546	at the end of her bed.
547	Expected her to, what,
548	just watch us two running around
549	like headless chickens?
550	I don't think I can cope
551	if things go wrong in there.
552	Things will not go wrong in there,
553	all right?
554	And I've got the mess out here.
555	Okay? I have it.
556	Thomas.
557	Hey, I miss you. Where'd you go?
558	Am I not worth investigating anymore?
559	Hey. I don't know if you remember me.
560	I was in last week.
561	Yeah.
562	I know. Um, listen, I showed you a photo...
563	You having a drink?
564	Uh, no, no. I'm okay. I'm just, um...
565	And, uh, whatever you're having.
566	So, I asked if this lad was in
567	watching the match on the Friday.
568	Yeah, I think so.
569	Hang on. You said you were certain before.
570	Did I?
571	Yeah, no. Yeah, you definitely did
572	'cause I-I took notes.
573	Probably. Look, I don't know.
574	I don't have a photograph memory.
575	Uh, okay.
576	Now, this one,
577	she was in on the Friday definitely.
578	Drank double whiskeys.
579	Didn't buy any herself, might I add.
580	Oh, come on.
581	Matt?
582	Tom? Tom?
583	I can't talk, Matt.
584	I have proof
585	that the sisters were lying.
586	What?
587	They weren't all together that night.
588	The night Williams died?
589	I fucking knew it.
590	The next couple of days
591	are just about Grace, all right?
592	Nobody tries anything,
593	nobody goes it alone. Okay?
594	No plans to. I need a drink.
595	Makes me feel alive!
596	Here we go!
597	JP?
598	Hold on tight, Mammy!
599	I've got this.
600	I know you were Oscar.
601	And I know you got me in trouble
602	with the police.
603	Um, Roger...
604	No. I don't want to hear lies.
605	I came here to ask you a question.
606	Ask away.
607	Why did you do it?
608	You were my friend.
609	Well, perhaps because I didn't like you
610	sniffing around my family,
611	because we are not friends.
612	And we never were.
613	You're just a sad old man
614	from across the street
615	that we tolerate
616	because we're nice people.
617	And because you probably would fiddle
618	with kids if you could, wouldn't you?
619	And I forgive you.
620	Forgiveness flows down.
621	Remember that.
622	Have any of you heard from Eva?
623	She's not answering me.
624	We need to get hammered. Like, medically.
625	Three double whiskeys?
626	Actually, make it two.
627	What? Why?
628	Ben is staying nearby.
629	It's my last night with him.
630	Does he know that?
631	Not yet.
632	Anyway, I'll be back bright and early
633	to take us all to Grace's.
634	Don't believe any of that
635	“last night together” crap.
636	The horny bitch.
637	Pub?
638	No. I think I'm just gonna hit the sack.
639	Would you text me when Eva gets back?
640	You know Ursula got the pen to?
641	What?
642	Eva wouldn't do anything
643	without telling us.
644	What, you think she's gonna do it?
645	I think she thinks she's gonna.
646	What does that mean?
647	Becka?
648	Becka!
649	I was just thinking how nice it is
650	when it's just the two of us.
651	Do you really have to go
652	and see your sisters tomorrow?
653	Oh, JP, it's too late to cancel now.
654	And I'll be back by lunch.
655	Your sisters never really liked me,
656	did they?
657	But do you know how much it hurts
658	when I feel that you love them
659	more than me?
660	But that's not true.
661	Good.
662	To “just us.”
663	Just us.
664	Becka?
665	I wish he'd leave us alone.
666	Without him,
667	we could go back to the way we were.
668	Oi.
669	Where did you go last night?
670	Very muddy pub.
671	Jesus.
672	What is wrong with you?
673	Just checking you're here.
674	Where else would I be?
675	Ben?
676	Shit!
677	Think I should call Urs?
678	Why?
679	She's barely phoning it in these days.
680	What's wrong?
681	I don't wanna go in.
682	No, I will not.
683	Just put your party hats on and be normal.
684	Put your party hat on. Please.
685	Please!
686	And your party face.
687	That's better.
688	John Paul is dead.
689	He's dead, Eva. He's dead.
