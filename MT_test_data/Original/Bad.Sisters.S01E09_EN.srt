1
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:26,695
This is to tie it up.

2
00:00:26,777 --> 00:00:29,030
Oh, no! And what happened there?

3
00:00:32,951 --> 00:00:34,286
It's weird she hasn't called.

4
00:00:36,246 --> 00:00:38,789
You'd call us if Donal
didn't come home one night, right?

5
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,165
Don't know. Would I?

6
00:00:42,293 --> 00:00:44,963
She'll probably call the police first,
right?

7
00:00:48,633 --> 00:00:49,843
Are you not talking to me?

8
00:00:49,926 --> 00:00:53,220
I am talking to you. I'm still processing.

9
00:00:54,264 --> 00:00:55,765
You shouldn't have let her go rogue.

10
00:00:55,848 --> 00:00:57,975
Now she's got to
carry that burden of guilt.

11
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:00,246
You weren't concerned about me
when I was going to shoot him.

12
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:01,396
Or me.

13
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:02,981
Well, she's younger than…

14
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:05,775
She's practically a kid.

15
00:01:05,858 --> 00:01:08,944
She's 29.
What's the cutoff age for killing a man?

16
00:01:09,028 --> 00:01:10,822
Anyway, we're not a firing squad.

17
00:01:11,614 --> 00:01:14,242
We always knew one of us
would get the final bullet.

18
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:16,328
Nice.

19
00:02:41,329 --> 00:02:42,389
Becka.

20
00:02:42,413 --> 00:02:44,623
Wait. Wait. Becka, wait!

21
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:47,937
- I can't breathe.
- There must've been tools in there!

22
00:02:47,961 --> 00:02:50,230
- Was there tools in there?
- There's no tools. We checked!

23
00:02:50,254 --> 00:02:52,549
- What happened?
- He's unkillable. He's like a cockroach.

24
00:02:52,632 --> 00:02:53,966
Someone was in that room!

25
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:57,094
What if it was Minna?

26
00:02:58,513 --> 00:02:59,514
What am I missing?

27
00:03:00,348 --> 00:03:02,492
Birthday planning!
Get back in there, you big eavesdropper.

28
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:03,727
Get in.

29
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:05,037
- Get in!
- Sorry!

30
00:03:06,229 --> 00:03:07,622
I have to go over there.

31
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:10,567
- No, wait, wait, wait. What do...
- Why is he here? He never comes.

32
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:12,370
It doesn't matter.
It's good that he's here.

33
00:03:12,443 --> 00:03:14,905
We'll keep him here
while you check on Minna, okay?

34
00:03:14,987 --> 00:03:18,199
Okay, look, walk! Don't run.
We're gonna say you're sick.

35
00:03:18,283 --> 00:03:19,867
I actually do feel sick.

36
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,243
What?

37
00:03:21,328 --> 00:03:22,704
Right, kids, dinner!

38
00:03:22,787 --> 00:03:23,913
Coming now!

39
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:27,183
So, Blanaid, did your daddy threaten
to cancel your pocket money?

40
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,209
Is that what happened?

41
00:03:28,293 --> 00:03:30,086
Fat chance.

42
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:36,091
Road rage incident. Very angry chap.
Um, got his license number though.

43
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:39,554
Um, JP, why don't you take a seat?

44
00:03:39,638 --> 00:03:43,849
Uh, no, I'm not staying.
Um, I'm headed over to my mum's.

45
00:03:43,933 --> 00:03:46,478
No. What? What... Stay.

46
00:03:46,561 --> 00:03:48,812
You can, uh, have, uh... have Becka's seat.

47
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:50,189
Oh, yeah.

48
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:52,025
That's a great idea, JP. Stay.

49
00:03:52,108 --> 00:03:53,735
No. I just wanted to drop the girls off.

50
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:56,655
I need to bring Mum her shopping.
Should've done it last night.

51
00:04:09,751 --> 00:04:10,835
Minna!

52
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:14,381
Minna, it's me!

53
00:04:16,507 --> 00:04:17,507
Minna!

54
00:04:47,956 --> 00:04:50,667
You called Becka.
Leave a message, you weirdo.

55
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:54,129
Becka, he's going round there,
so just... please...

56
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:57,673
Just listen to this bloody message!

57
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:01,177
Hey!

58
00:05:01,261 --> 00:05:02,762
Will we serve up dessert?

59
00:05:03,262 --> 00:05:05,514
Absolutely. Yeah, get stuck in.

60
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:10,312
Everyone's a bit weird today.

61
00:05:10,394 --> 00:05:11,646
Are they?

62
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:15,233
I don't know why.

63
00:05:15,317 --> 00:05:17,401
Oh, my God.

64
00:05:24,742 --> 00:05:28,704
- Mama! Where are you?
- Oh, shit. Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

65
00:05:28,788 --> 00:05:32,250
Where are you?
I've got some groceries for you.

66
00:05:32,334 --> 00:05:36,129
Got some, uh... Argh! Ooh, soggy. Um…

67
00:05:36,213 --> 00:05:40,007
Looks like you'll be eating fish fingers
for a few days.

68
00:05:40,091 --> 00:05:41,468
Mama!

69
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:49,935
Mama!

70
00:05:50,018 --> 00:05:51,353
Shit, shit.

71
00:05:51,435 --> 00:05:52,562
Mama!

72
00:05:52,646 --> 00:05:53,771
Where are you?

73
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,752
Mama!

74
00:07:35,624 --> 00:07:38,918
But Mama, what are you doing?

75
00:07:44,966 --> 00:07:46,425
What are you doing, Mama?

76
00:07:54,725 --> 00:07:55,894
Oh, you're so cold!

77
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,985
Oh. Hi. I thought I'd check in on Min.

78
00:08:45,485 --> 00:08:47,028
I thought you were sick.

79
00:08:47,111 --> 00:08:48,779
Sick of my sisters.

80
00:08:48,863 --> 00:08:50,823
- Felt like a Minna day.
- Mmm.

81
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:55,412
She's, um... She's sleeping.

82
00:08:55,495 --> 00:08:56,788
- I'll come in and wait.
- No.

83
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,499
Don't like you hanging around here,
giving her ideas.

84
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:01,167
Go away.

85
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:20,519
Ah, fuck!

86
00:09:37,412 --> 00:09:39,331
Oh, Becka. Thank Christ!

87
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:40,749
He said she's sleeping.

88
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:42,584
What, you talked to him?

89
00:09:42,667 --> 00:09:44,387
- I need to know.
- What did you say to him?

90
00:09:44,461 --> 00:09:46,671
Nothing.
I just said I fancied a Minna day.

91
00:09:46,754 --> 00:09:48,215
I have to get in that house.

92
00:09:48,298 --> 00:09:50,383
Look. I know this is awful, not knowing,

93
00:09:50,466 --> 00:09:53,260
but forcing your way in there
is only going to make things worse.

94
00:09:53,345 --> 00:09:54,346
She's right.

95
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:57,640
We just need to act like normal, okay?
Wait it out.

96
00:09:57,724 --> 00:09:59,451
Go in and lie down.
I'll get you a plate of food.

97
00:09:59,475 --> 00:10:00,475
I can't eat.

98
00:10:00,518 --> 00:10:02,854
Well,
then I will bring you a box of wine, okay?

99
00:10:02,937 --> 00:10:04,855
- Just go and lie down.
- I can't lie down.

100
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:07,234
Well, just pace about then,
but do it here.

101
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,277
Not outside Minna's.

102
00:10:12,072 --> 00:10:15,408
- If Minna's in there...
- I can't even think about that.

103
00:10:15,491 --> 00:10:19,870
- I'm saying he might suspect...
- No. No, it looked like an accident.

104
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,706
If she is in there,

105
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:25,501
then he's the one with the problem.

106
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:05,667
What the…

107
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:30,149
What service do you require?

108
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:34,778
I just found my mother
unresponsive in bed.

109
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:42,328
I think she may have...
Have died in her sleep last night.

110
00:11:42,412 --> 00:11:44,538
When was she last conscious? Do you know?

111
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:49,668
Hello? Excuse me, sir,
are you still there?

112
00:12:01,847 --> 00:12:04,517
Answer it.

113
00:12:07,604 --> 00:12:08,897
Hey, honey.

114
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:11,857
I'm just here with all the girls.
You all right?

115
00:12:12,775 --> 00:12:17,322
I'm glad you're together.
I... I didn't want Becka to be on her own.

116
00:12:18,155 --> 00:12:20,783
Becka, Minna's dead.

117
00:12:20,866 --> 00:12:22,826
No. Grace.

118
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:25,163
She passed away last night in her sleep.

119
00:12:25,246 --> 00:12:28,041
- In her sleep?
- I'm so sorry.

120
00:12:28,124 --> 00:12:30,793
If there's anything we can do, just...

121
00:12:30,876 --> 00:12:34,213
John Paul needs me now. Talk later, okay?

122
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:37,841
Okay, honey. We love you.

123
00:12:39,635 --> 00:12:41,428
Oh, Becka.

124
00:12:41,513 --> 00:12:43,974
What have I done?

125
00:12:44,057 --> 00:12:47,059
Listen. Listen to me!
None of this would have happened

126
00:12:47,143 --> 00:12:50,105
if the prick hadn't have
locked his dead dad in a fucking freezer!

127
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:53,567
She must have known George was in there.
She must have gone to see him.

128
00:12:53,649 --> 00:12:57,445
- I know. Yeah. Yeah.
- Or maybe she actually died in bed.

129
00:12:58,196 --> 00:13:01,950
Christ's sake. He's covering his tracks!

130
00:13:02,033 --> 00:13:05,620
No, he can't.
He can't get away with this too.

131
00:13:05,703 --> 00:13:08,724
I mean, if he's gonna lie about Minna,
then I'll tell the truth about George.

132
00:13:08,748 --> 00:13:11,293
I'll take him down even...
Even if I go down too.

133
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:14,169
No. No, because if you go down,
we all go down.

134
00:13:14,254 --> 00:13:15,672
Shut up, Ursula!

135
00:13:15,754 --> 00:13:17,923
We need to get in there
before he moves his body.

136
00:13:18,008 --> 00:13:21,219
- And... And do what?
- I... I don't know! Photograph it!

137
00:13:21,302 --> 00:13:24,471
- And... And then what?
- We can't go to the police.

138
00:13:24,556 --> 00:13:26,057
You do get that, don't you, Becka?

139
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,350
I don't want to hear her.

140
00:13:27,433 --> 00:13:29,351
Just, please.

141
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:34,024
Okay. Better we have a photograph
than no photograph.

142
00:13:34,106 --> 00:13:35,900
- No.
- Just so we have something

143
00:13:35,984 --> 00:13:37,693
to use against him if we need it.

144
00:13:37,777 --> 00:13:38,903
No, it's too risky.

145
00:13:38,986 --> 00:13:41,364
Well, I'm going over there
with or without you lot.

146
00:13:41,447 --> 00:13:43,908
No, I'll... I'll come with you. Okay?

147
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:51,582
What the hell? Where is he?

148
00:13:53,335 --> 00:13:54,961
I can't believe this is happening.

149
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,881
Becka.

150
00:14:01,259 --> 00:14:02,594
I need to get out of here.

151
00:14:02,677 --> 00:14:03,677
Okay.

152
00:14:15,606 --> 00:14:17,317
Oh, shit.

153
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:20,153
What are you doing here?

154
00:14:20,236 --> 00:14:22,197
- We were just...
- I wanted to see the...

155
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:23,572
See what?

156
00:14:23,657 --> 00:14:26,993
We were just... Becka thought she left some
massage equipment here, so we...

157
00:14:27,076 --> 00:14:29,287
What? In the freezer room?

158
00:14:31,581 --> 00:14:35,168
We didn't go into any freezer room.
We... We were just going. Sorry.

159
00:14:38,004 --> 00:14:40,048
Becka, I know you were here last night.

160
00:14:43,552 --> 00:14:45,678
You pierced her nose.

161
00:14:45,761 --> 00:14:47,931
I took it out
'cause it made her look cheap.

162
00:14:50,475 --> 00:14:51,684
Sorry for your loss.

163
00:15:03,404 --> 00:15:06,783
He knows. He bloody knows.

164
00:15:06,865 --> 00:15:08,493
What else would we be doing down there?

165
00:15:08,576 --> 00:15:11,245
- He knows we know about George.
- I don't care if he knows.

166
00:15:11,328 --> 00:15:13,163
I care that Minna is dead.

167
00:15:13,248 --> 00:15:15,166
- I-I care that I did it.
- Yeah, we did it.

168
00:15:16,042 --> 00:15:17,418
You didn't even know about it.

169
00:15:18,086 --> 00:15:20,754
I started this. We are all guilty.

170
00:15:21,798 --> 00:15:24,676
- Oh, shit. Does he know that?
- I mean, does he know that we...

171
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:26,135
Stop talking about him.

172
00:15:27,888 --> 00:15:30,014
My heart is gonna break, Eva.

173
00:15:32,225 --> 00:15:35,144
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

174
00:15:37,438 --> 00:15:39,399
Sorry, Becka.

175
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:42,777
Becka. B…

176
00:15:45,572 --> 00:15:46,615
Becka!

177
00:17:01,105 --> 00:17:02,731
You totally went off radar.

178
00:17:04,401 --> 00:17:06,443
You didn't tell me you dug up JP's body.

179
00:17:07,112 --> 00:17:10,990
So tell me the truth because,
um, my brother is losing his mind.

180
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:14,618
Funny enough, Matt,
I don't care about your brother.

181
00:17:15,494 --> 00:17:16,662
I care about my sister.

182
00:17:16,746 --> 00:17:18,832
You're not paying her
what she's due. Why's that?

183
00:17:18,914 --> 00:17:22,544
You were at the marina
the night JP took a dip.

184
00:17:22,626 --> 00:17:24,545
Gabriel saw you with Eva.

185
00:17:24,628 --> 00:17:28,048
Yeah, we were out driving or messing.
I was pissed.

186
00:17:28,132 --> 00:17:31,553
I made Eva take me to Gabriel's boat.
I thought we could have a drink on board.

187
00:17:31,635 --> 00:17:33,512
So, you didn't see JP's car?

188
00:17:33,596 --> 00:17:36,098
We didn't notice any cars.
We were looking at the boats.

189
00:17:37,142 --> 00:17:38,183
Why are you asking?

190
00:17:38,268 --> 00:17:40,854
And this bullshit friendship with Minna.
What was that about?

191
00:17:41,438 --> 00:17:43,064
It wasn't a bullshit friendship.

192
00:17:47,861 --> 00:17:49,863
I saw the check she made out to you,
Becka.

193
00:17:49,945 --> 00:17:51,405
The antique check?

194
00:17:53,365 --> 00:17:55,160
Did you notice it wasn't cashed?

195
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:57,597
You wouldn't understand anything
about that

196
00:17:57,621 --> 00:17:59,902
because all you and your brother
can think about is money.

197
00:17:59,955 --> 00:18:03,125
Coming from the woman who was happy
to take a handout from a man she hated.

198
00:18:03,209 --> 00:18:04,044
That's not what...

199
00:18:04,126 --> 00:18:06,563
Oh, was it a coincidence
she died a few weeks before John Paul...

200
00:18:06,587 --> 00:18:09,965
- Yes, it was a fucking coincidence!
- Oh, you're a hypocrite, Becka!

201
00:18:10,049 --> 00:18:11,384
And you use people.

202
00:18:11,468 --> 00:18:13,987
You saw Minna and took an opportunity.
You're doing the same with me.

203
00:18:14,011 --> 00:18:16,890
You're the hypocrite!
You pretended to like me.

204
00:18:18,391 --> 00:18:21,728
- Minna was my friend, and I miss her!
- Stop, Becka.

205
00:18:22,645 --> 00:18:24,980
- I miss her!
- Stop.

206
00:18:26,566 --> 00:18:27,983
I'm sorry.

207
00:18:33,448 --> 00:18:34,448
I'm sorry.

208
00:19:18,076 --> 00:19:19,493
Hey. Is everything okay?

209
00:19:20,202 --> 00:19:21,203
Yeah.

210
00:19:23,748 --> 00:19:24,915
Where are you?

211
00:19:27,501 --> 00:19:28,670
You're with her.

212
00:19:31,088 --> 00:19:34,092
- Yeah.
- You're a fool. She's lying to you.

213
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:37,429
They killed him in Wick low.
I can't prove it, but I know they did it.

214
00:19:49,065 --> 00:19:50,775
Someone want a little cuddle?

215
00:20:10,836 --> 00:20:12,963
Tom? Tom?

216
00:20:17,469 --> 00:20:19,679
You have to pay out? Is that what this is?

217
00:20:21,597 --> 00:20:26,228
Uh, okay, so… we're bankrupt.

218
00:20:27,144 --> 00:20:28,896
Well, at least it's done. Over.

219
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,272
I've been trying so hard.

220
00:20:30,356 --> 00:20:32,275
I-I don't care.

221
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:36,320
I care about you and having this baby.

222
00:20:37,239 --> 00:20:38,530
Look, come here.

223
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:42,618
We can live in a box out the back
of a Harvey Norman.

224
00:20:42,701 --> 00:20:45,288
I don't give a shit
as long as I have you both.

225
00:20:51,836 --> 00:20:53,672
Matt's in love with the Garvey girl.

226
00:20:53,755 --> 00:20:55,257
Well, I told you that.

227
00:20:56,508 --> 00:20:58,634
I'd like a face-to-face
with those Garveys.

228
00:21:00,053 --> 00:21:01,596
What is she like?

229
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:04,598
Aside from being an accomplice to murder?

230
00:21:04,682 --> 00:21:06,726
I don't know. Fit?

231
00:21:11,565 --> 00:21:13,275
There's something else, isn't there?

232
00:21:22,409 --> 00:21:25,537
If we can't pay the Williams claim,
there will be an investigation.

233
00:21:26,829 --> 00:21:28,330
- Right. And?
- And…

234
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,001
Well, they'll find a mess.

235
00:21:33,502 --> 00:21:36,172
- What kind of mess?
- A fraudulent mess.

236
00:21:38,884 --> 00:21:42,721
The Williams case was never processed.
There was no cover.

237
00:21:43,596 --> 00:21:47,017
Dad just took the monthly payments,
and he spent them.

238
00:21:47,099 --> 00:21:48,934
If there's an investigation,

239
00:21:49,019 --> 00:21:51,688
they'll find that
and all the other policies

240
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:53,815
that weren't worth the paper
they were written on.

241
00:21:53,898 --> 00:21:57,736
He embezzled his clients for years,
and I've helped to cover it up.

242
00:21:59,445 --> 00:22:01,448
Are you talking jail time, Thomas?

243
00:22:16,253 --> 00:22:19,048
- Sorry for your loss.
- Don't bring him on us, Eva.

244
00:22:22,719 --> 00:22:25,096
Come here.

245
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,348
Poor little thing.

246
00:22:33,395 --> 00:22:35,941
Urs isn't coming.

247
00:22:36,023 --> 00:22:38,108
Why? It's so much fun.

248
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:41,947
Minna would've hated this.

249
00:22:44,782 --> 00:22:46,492
She deserved a proper send-off.

250
00:22:46,576 --> 00:22:49,246
Yeah. A dry funeral.

251
00:22:50,163 --> 00:22:52,499
She was always half-pissed
every time I saw her.

252
00:22:52,582 --> 00:22:54,084
She had dementia, Bibi.

253
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,336
No, I mean on top of that.

254
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:01,883
This was her favorite.
I'll drink to her if no one else will.

255
00:23:01,967 --> 00:23:03,593
That's not gonna help, honey.

256
00:23:05,345 --> 00:23:07,137
That is rich coming from you.

257
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:13,228
I need a breather from her.

258
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:15,646
Make sure she doesn't do anything stupid.

259
00:23:31,746 --> 00:23:33,623
- What happened?
- Doesn't matter.

260
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:36,542
He's calling it a road rage incident.

261
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:37,877
I had a word with him.

262
00:23:37,961 --> 00:23:39,921
- What did you say?
- I told him to stay away.

263
00:23:40,005 --> 00:23:41,605
- And then you hit him?
- Yes, I hit him.

264
00:23:41,673 --> 00:23:43,215
Christ's sake, Ben.

265
00:23:43,924 --> 00:23:45,594
Why did you have to fan the flame?

266
00:23:48,387 --> 00:23:49,471
Did anyone see you?

267
00:23:50,472 --> 00:23:52,142
What do you expect me to do?

268
00:23:52,767 --> 00:23:55,604
After what he did to you,
the scumbag should be in jail.

269
00:24:00,567 --> 00:24:01,609
Show me your hand.

270
00:24:14,038 --> 00:24:15,205
You did that for me?

271
00:24:25,174 --> 00:24:26,800
I'd do anything for you, Urs.

272
00:24:41,691 --> 00:24:43,484
People keep saying it was her time.

273
00:24:45,153 --> 00:24:46,779
Well, she had a long life.

274
00:24:46,863 --> 00:24:48,615
But she wasn't ready to die.

275
00:24:49,406 --> 00:24:52,701
I think your mother died the day
you told her that George had left her.

276
00:24:52,786 --> 00:24:55,079
All she did was find her way back to him.

277
00:24:55,913 --> 00:24:57,123
Hey.

278
00:24:57,624 --> 00:24:59,166
Hey. You okay?

279
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:01,377
I'm grand, really.
I'm just worried about this man.

280
00:25:01,461 --> 00:25:02,295
- Mmm.
- Yeah.

281
00:25:02,378 --> 00:25:03,797
Let's get away, Mammy.

282
00:25:04,463 --> 00:25:07,925
Go up to the cabin for your birthday.
Dust off the quad bike.

283
00:25:08,009 --> 00:25:10,220
Well, she hates quad biking.

284
00:25:10,303 --> 00:25:13,973
And she's gonna be spending her birthday
with her sisters like she always does.

285
00:25:14,057 --> 00:25:16,308
She's my wife, and she spends it with me.

286
00:25:16,393 --> 00:25:18,561
Cabin's not ready. It's a building site.

287
00:25:18,644 --> 00:25:20,480
Just needs a woman's touch, really.

288
00:25:20,564 --> 00:25:23,191
Well, how about you lot
join us the next morning,

289
00:25:23,275 --> 00:25:25,442
and we could have a half day
at the hotel spa?

290
00:25:25,527 --> 00:25:28,488
Oh, my God. Do you remember my 35th?

291
00:25:28,571 --> 00:25:31,700
We all got drunk at the bar
and then went back to the cabin.

292
00:25:31,782 --> 00:25:34,451
We're not doing a rerun
of that car crash of a night.

293
00:25:35,161 --> 00:25:37,788
No drunken stragglers this time.

294
00:25:38,623 --> 00:25:40,375
I'm fine. I'll see you later.

295
00:25:42,085 --> 00:25:43,086
Eva.

296
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:46,131
Oh, um, she's upset.

297
00:25:46,213 --> 00:25:49,800
- Um, I'll call you. I love you.
- Oh, okay. I love you. Yeah, do.

298
00:25:49,884 --> 00:25:50,719
Becka!

299
00:25:50,801 --> 00:25:52,177
You all right, Pebble?

300
00:25:53,012 --> 00:25:55,973
Mmm, yeah, we're okay.
I'm worried about John Paul and…

301
00:25:57,142 --> 00:25:58,143
Grace.

302
00:26:14,241 --> 00:26:15,242
Oscar.

303
00:26:26,086 --> 00:26:28,173
We are restructuring, Eva.

304
00:26:29,715 --> 00:26:32,719
Where formerly, staff came to you
to sign off on client accounts,

305
00:26:32,801 --> 00:26:34,721
they will now come to me.

306
00:26:35,888 --> 00:26:37,557
And that includes you.

307
00:26:39,517 --> 00:26:41,310
And you agree to this?

308
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:44,689
JP says there have been
some errors of late, um...

309
00:26:44,772 --> 00:26:47,983
- What, and you believe him?
- Yes, I believe him, Eva.

310
00:26:48,067 --> 00:26:51,654
You've been distracted recently.
Not yourself at all, if I'm honest.

311
00:26:52,572 --> 00:26:55,241
And there's been complaints.

312
00:26:55,741 --> 00:26:57,952
There's been complaints?
Well, what exactly...

313
00:26:58,036 --> 00:27:02,289
From clients, um,
about the smell of drink off you.

314
00:27:03,165 --> 00:27:07,002
And not just your breath.
You're sweating alcohol, it seems…

315
00:27:09,422 --> 00:27:10,673
Which says something.

316
00:27:18,597 --> 00:27:20,933
Eva. Eva.

317
00:27:45,666 --> 00:27:47,210
Grace will be upset by this,

318
00:27:47,294 --> 00:27:49,671
so I hope we can keep it civil
for her sake.

319
00:27:49,753 --> 00:27:53,592
Because, Eva, I'm not going anywhere.

320
00:27:54,925 --> 00:27:57,761
I know Becka was there
the night that Minna died,

321
00:27:57,846 --> 00:27:59,972
and I wondered,
"Why would she want to hurt Minna?"

322
00:28:00,056 --> 00:28:01,057
But there's no answer.

323
00:28:01,141 --> 00:28:04,102
And then I had this strange memory
of seeing her in my bedroom

324
00:28:04,184 --> 00:28:05,895
the night I fell into the marina.

325
00:28:05,979 --> 00:28:09,607
And I thought, "Ah, come on.
Don't be stupid. How could that be?"

326
00:28:09,691 --> 00:28:13,444
But here she is again, one more time,
in a place where she shouldn't be.

327
00:28:14,278 --> 00:28:17,406
And then,
I remembered something else this morning.

328
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:22,537
I remembered
the Garvey girls are like rats.

329
00:28:23,163 --> 00:28:27,250
Where there's one, there's more,
which is why you need to poison the nest.

330
00:28:28,292 --> 00:28:32,130
Get away from my car,
or I will mow you down like roadkill.

331
00:28:32,213 --> 00:28:34,798
Okay, sure. No problem. Please.

332
00:28:51,357 --> 00:28:54,903
- Emergency. Which service?
- Jesus, that was quick.

333
00:28:55,694 --> 00:28:58,530
It's okay. You're here.

334
00:29:03,953 --> 00:29:07,332
Yeah, no. Okay. No. We're
not doing that. No, no. Okay, we got it.

335
00:29:07,414 --> 00:29:09,834
Kept him in the freezer for years.

336
00:29:09,917 --> 00:29:12,836
Jesus Christ. That's why she...

337
00:29:12,921 --> 00:29:13,922
Sorry!

338
00:29:15,464 --> 00:29:16,674
Thank you!

339
00:29:17,424 --> 00:29:20,010
I didn't believe her about George, Eva.

340
00:29:20,095 --> 00:29:21,221
Okay.

341
00:29:21,304 --> 00:29:23,472
God. Her um...

342
00:29:23,557 --> 00:29:26,308
Her friend died recently, so she's...

343
00:29:26,393 --> 00:29:29,354
She's been sick,
so should be the worst of it over.

344
00:29:29,436 --> 00:29:31,605
- Okay.
- It was all over the grave though,

345
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:33,900
so you might want to call Father Doyle
in the morning.

346
00:29:33,983 --> 00:29:36,193
Offer to sluice it out or…

347
00:29:36,278 --> 00:29:39,322
Father D... Yeah. No, I will.
I-I'll do that. Yeah.

348
00:29:39,405 --> 00:29:43,201
They're not listening to me!
Tell them I killed Minna.

349
00:29:43,285 --> 00:29:44,911
I'll kill you in a second.

350
00:29:44,994 --> 00:29:47,595
Hey, do you know, if you have
any Dioralyte at home, that'll help.

351
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,624
Brilliant idea. Thank you.

352
00:29:50,125 --> 00:29:51,835
Nice house!

353
00:29:51,917 --> 00:29:53,336
Thank you.

354
00:29:55,046 --> 00:29:56,463
Tell them!

355
00:29:56,548 --> 00:29:57,673
Please shut up.

356
00:29:59,425 --> 00:30:02,304
Oh, my God.
I can't believe she spoke to the police.

357
00:30:02,386 --> 00:30:05,848
- Just calm down. It was two local morons.
- She's a liability.

358
00:30:05,932 --> 00:30:08,643
I told you this is what would happen
if you involved her, didn't I?

359
00:30:08,727 --> 00:30:10,561
I am fucking here, you know.

360
00:30:10,644 --> 00:30:12,939
Look, I know this is hard,

361
00:30:13,022 --> 00:30:17,527
okay, but you are just gonna
have to find a way to carry it.

362
00:30:17,611 --> 00:30:19,278
That's easy for you to say.

363
00:30:19,362 --> 00:30:22,156
He didn't take your eye or blackmail you.

364
00:30:22,949 --> 00:30:24,491
Put blood on your hands.

365
00:30:29,998 --> 00:30:32,750
Sorry. I know what he did to you.

366
00:30:34,877 --> 00:30:36,671
Gabriel and your work.

367
00:30:40,967 --> 00:30:43,385
That euthanasia drug
that you were telling us about.

368
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:45,614
- Can you get that at the hospital?
- What the hell, Eva?

369
00:30:45,638 --> 00:30:50,101
No, I'm gonna finish this.
I'm gonna do it this weekend in Wick low.

370
00:30:50,184 --> 00:30:51,810
No. No.

371
00:30:51,894 --> 00:30:54,439
We are going there
to give Grace a decent birthday.

372
00:30:54,521 --> 00:30:57,317
What he said to me at work,
that was a threat.

373
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,653
He is onto us now.

374
00:30:59,736 --> 00:31:01,696
- He's onto us?
- Well, what exactly does he know?

375
00:31:01,738 --> 00:31:04,449
- It's what he suspects.
- Which is what?

376
00:31:04,531 --> 00:31:06,826
That Becka had something
to do with Minna's death,

377
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:09,203
- or that we're trying to kill him?
- I don't know.

378
00:31:09,287 --> 00:31:10,329
All of it.

379
00:31:12,164 --> 00:31:13,333
Can you get it?

380
00:31:13,415 --> 00:31:16,086
Pentobarbital? Not from work, no.

381
00:31:18,296 --> 00:31:21,799
- I know a dodgy vet. I could ask him.
- Oh, my...

382
00:31:22,299 --> 00:31:25,470
It's too dangerous to rush into it like
this. You're being completely reckless.

383
00:31:25,554 --> 00:31:27,806
You're the one who wanted him dead
in the first place.

384
00:31:27,888 --> 00:31:29,057
I could do it.

385
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:31,180
I've got blood on my hands anyway.

386
00:31:32,018 --> 00:31:33,519
Might as well be hung for a sheep.

387
00:31:33,603 --> 00:31:34,770
No one's getting hung.

388
00:31:35,355 --> 00:31:36,897
This is mine.

389
00:31:36,981 --> 00:31:39,858
I can do this. I know I can.

390
00:31:39,942 --> 00:31:40,986
Is that a fact?

391
00:31:41,944 --> 00:31:44,698
'Cause right now, I think you are more
of a liability than she is.

392
00:31:45,574 --> 00:31:46,825
We are not doing it.

393
00:31:55,458 --> 00:31:56,710
Get the stuff.

394
00:32:05,134 --> 00:32:06,260
I'll be back in an hour.

395
00:32:06,344 --> 00:32:08,721
Don't look so worried.
I won't tell him anything.

396
00:32:09,388 --> 00:32:11,223
I just want to suss out the legalities.

397
00:32:11,849 --> 00:32:14,978
No point in having a solicitor for a pal
if you don't use them, right?

398
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:16,563
You don't have pals.

399
00:32:17,564 --> 00:32:18,565
That's true.

400
00:32:19,231 --> 00:32:20,442
I love you, Thomas.

401
00:32:22,861 --> 00:32:24,028
I know.

402
00:32:42,588 --> 00:32:47,594
Okay.

403
00:33:32,513 --> 00:33:33,515
No.

404
00:33:44,276 --> 00:33:45,609
Gotcha, Becka Garvey.

405
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:09,592
Forgot me bloody wallet.

406
00:34:10,342 --> 00:34:13,096
Figured I'd have to buy him a drink
at least or-or something.

407
00:34:14,306 --> 00:34:15,389
Theresa.

408
00:34:17,016 --> 00:34:20,936
Theresa! Theresa!
Theresa, you okay? Can you hear me?

409
00:34:21,021 --> 00:34:24,900
Fuck!
You're all right. You're all right.

410
00:34:24,983 --> 00:34:27,863
- What service do you require?
- Hello? I need an ambulance!

411
00:34:28,068 --> 00:34:32,489
Thomas? Thomas!

412
00:34:32,574 --> 00:34:34,742
I felt a bit weird
picking out knickers for Theresa,

413
00:34:34,826 --> 00:34:38,079
- but I just closed my eyes.
- I haven't time for this shit.

414
00:34:38,163 --> 00:34:41,458
Hey. Hey, wait. Thomas. What's going on?

415
00:34:42,041 --> 00:34:43,835
- She had a seizure.
- What?

416
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:48,505
I just had some 23-year-old
with the emotional depth of a Chihuahua

417
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:49,590
lay it out for me.

418
00:34:49,672 --> 00:34:52,385
I could lose her. I could lose my baby.
I could lose them both.

419
00:34:52,469 --> 00:34:54,846
No, it won't...
You won't lose them, Thomas.

420
00:34:55,554 --> 00:34:57,891
She was going to see Becka Garvey.
Did you know that?

421
00:34:59,016 --> 00:35:01,728
That's what she was doing
before she collapsed.

422
00:35:01,811 --> 00:35:03,271
This is my fault.

423
00:35:03,355 --> 00:35:05,231
I dumped all this shite
at the end of her bed.

424
00:35:05,315 --> 00:35:07,525
Expected her to, what,

425
00:35:07,608 --> 00:35:10,110
just watch us two running around
like headless chickens?

426
00:35:10,612 --> 00:35:14,365
I don't think I can cope
if things go wrong in there.

427
00:35:14,449 --> 00:35:16,492
Things will not go wrong in there,
all right?

428
00:35:17,202 --> 00:35:20,246
And I've got the mess out here.
Okay? I have it.

429
00:35:21,456 --> 00:35:22,623
Thomas.

430
00:35:28,922 --> 00:35:31,550
Hey, I miss you. Where'd you go?

431
00:35:32,425 --> 00:35:34,385
Am I not worth investigating anymore?

432
00:36:24,768 --> 00:36:28,023
Hey. I don't know if you remember me.
I was in last week.

433
00:36:28,106 --> 00:36:30,817
Ah, you think I could forget that face?

434
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:33,820
Yeah.
I know. Um, listen, I showed you a photo...

435
00:36:33,903 --> 00:36:35,237
You having a drink?

436
00:36:35,322 --> 00:36:37,574
Uh, no, no. I'm okay. I'm just, um…

437
00:36:39,867 --> 00:36:43,371
Yeah, I-I'll have a pint of,
uh, what's that, lager?

438
00:36:43,996 --> 00:36:45,331
And, uh, whatever you're having.

439
00:36:47,708 --> 00:36:53,505
So, I asked if this lad was in
watching the match on the Friday.

440
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:55,842
Yeah, I think so.

441
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:59,804
Hang on. You said you were certain before.

442
00:36:59,887 --> 00:37:01,139
Did I?

443
00:37:01,222 --> 00:37:04,934
Yeah, no. Yeah, you definitely did
'cause I-I took notes.

444
00:37:05,976 --> 00:37:07,436
Probably. Look, I don't know.

445
00:37:09,188 --> 00:37:11,733
- I don't have a photograph memory.
- Uh, okay.

446
00:37:11,815 --> 00:37:17,112
Um, so, can I ask if you saw
any of these ladies on the Friday?

447
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:21,992
Now, this one,
she was in on the Friday definitely.

448
00:37:22,077 --> 00:37:25,996
Drank double whiskeys.
Didn't buy any herself, might I add.

449
00:37:36,298 --> 00:37:37,509
Oh, come on.

450
00:37:37,592 --> 00:37:38,927
- Matt?
- Tom? Tom?

451
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:40,570
- I can't talk, Matt.
- I have proof

452
00:37:40,594 --> 00:37:42,681
- that the sisters were lying.
- What?

453
00:37:42,764 --> 00:37:44,431
They weren't all together that night.

454
00:37:44,516 --> 00:37:47,601
The night Williams died?
I fucking knew it.

455
00:38:39,945 --> 00:38:43,617
The next couple of days
are just about Grace, all right?

456
00:38:43,699 --> 00:38:47,996
Nobody tries anything,
nobody goes it alone. Okay?

457
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:51,206
No plans to. I need a drink.

458
00:39:06,222 --> 00:39:07,932
Makes me feel alive!

459
00:39:09,059 --> 00:39:12,144
I feel sick!

460
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:14,063
Here we go!

461
00:39:15,315 --> 00:39:16,358
JP?

462
00:39:17,733 --> 00:39:19,902
Hold on tight, Mammy!

463
00:39:25,115 --> 00:39:30,121
Careful. Careful!

464
00:39:57,481 --> 00:39:58,483
I've got this.

465
00:40:11,496 --> 00:40:12,914
I know you were Oscar.

466
00:40:13,706 --> 00:40:15,559
And I know you got me in trouble
with the police.

467
00:40:15,583 --> 00:40:18,670
- Um, Roger...
- No. I don't want to hear lies.

468
00:40:19,713 --> 00:40:21,672
I came here to ask you a question.

469
00:40:22,298 --> 00:40:23,300
Ask away.

470
00:40:24,885 --> 00:40:26,177
Why did you do it?

471
00:40:27,804 --> 00:40:29,097
You were my friend.

472
00:40:32,559 --> 00:40:35,978
Well, perhaps because I didn't like you
sniffing around my family,

473
00:40:36,061 --> 00:40:39,023
because we are not friends.

474
00:40:40,108 --> 00:40:41,860
And we never were.

475
00:40:41,943 --> 00:40:44,987
You're just a sad old man
from across the street

476
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:47,282
that we tolerate
because we're nice people.

477
00:40:47,364 --> 00:40:51,911
And because you probably would fiddle
with kids if you could, wouldn't you?

478
00:40:53,704 --> 00:40:55,748
- Do you know I prayed for you?
- Hmm.

479
00:40:58,460 --> 00:40:59,460
And I forgive you.

480
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:08,094
Um, people like you, Roger,
don't get to forgive people like me.

481
00:41:09,471 --> 00:41:11,722
Forgiveness flows down.

482
00:41:12,806 --> 00:41:13,807
Remember that.

483
00:41:23,985 --> 00:41:25,527
Who was that, hon?

484
00:41:26,278 --> 00:41:31,784
Uh, just some religious nut
lecturing me on forgiveness.

485
00:41:31,867 --> 00:41:32,869
Oh.

486
00:41:50,427 --> 00:41:53,639
Come on. Come on!

487
00:41:58,769 --> 00:42:01,356
Have any of you heard from Eva?
She's not answering me.

488
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:05,735
I don't know where she is,
but she's got our room key.

489
00:42:07,195 --> 00:42:09,822
We need to get hammered. Like, medically.

490
00:42:11,449 --> 00:42:13,659
- Three double whiskeys?
- Actually, make it two.

491
00:42:13,742 --> 00:42:14,742
What? Why?

492
00:42:15,661 --> 00:42:17,371
Ben is staying nearby.

493
00:42:19,206 --> 00:42:20,833
It's my last night with him.

494
00:42:21,626 --> 00:42:22,668
Does he know that?

495
00:42:24,336 --> 00:42:25,338
Not yet.

496
00:42:26,297 --> 00:42:29,384
Anyway, I'll be back bright and early
to take us all to Grace's.

497
00:42:31,969 --> 00:42:34,972
Don't believe any of that
"last night together" crap.

498
00:42:35,514 --> 00:42:37,141
The horny bitch.

499
00:42:37,934 --> 00:42:38,934
Pub?

500
00:42:39,518 --> 00:42:41,813
No. I think I'm just gonna hit the sack.

501
00:42:41,896 --> 00:42:43,606
Would you text me when Eva gets back?

502
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:46,568
You know Ursula got the pen to?

503
00:42:47,277 --> 00:42:48,485
What?

504
00:42:50,405 --> 00:42:52,740
Eva wouldn't do anything
without telling us.

505
00:42:55,242 --> 00:42:56,786
What, you think she's gonna do it?

506
00:42:57,621 --> 00:42:59,121
I think she thinks she's gonna.

507
00:42:59,204 --> 00:43:00,289
What does that mean?

508
00:43:02,918 --> 00:43:03,918
Becka?

509
00:43:04,878 --> 00:43:05,878
Becka!

510
00:43:14,221 --> 00:43:17,224
I was just thinking how nice it is
when it's just the two of us.

511
00:43:21,978 --> 00:43:24,940
Do you really have to go
and see your sisters tomorrow?

512
00:43:25,023 --> 00:43:27,358
Oh, JP, it's too late to cancel now.

513
00:43:28,025 --> 00:43:29,818
And I'll be back by lunch.

514
00:43:31,403 --> 00:43:33,614
Your sisters never really liked me,
did they?

515
00:43:42,791 --> 00:43:44,751
But do you know how much it hurts

516
00:43:45,793 --> 00:43:47,878
when I feel that you love them
more than me?

517
00:43:49,213 --> 00:43:50,465
But that's not true.

518
00:43:54,802 --> 00:43:56,554
Good.

519
00:43:57,681 --> 00:43:59,306
To "just us."

520
00:44:00,099 --> 00:44:01,226
Just us.

521
00:44:21,746 --> 00:44:22,831
Becka?

522
00:44:55,195 --> 00:44:56,907
I wish he'd leave us alone.

523
00:44:58,867 --> 00:45:02,119
Without him,
we could go back to the way we were.

524
00:45:38,572 --> 00:45:39,574
Oi.

525
00:45:41,576 --> 00:45:42,952
Where did you go last night?

526
00:45:44,286 --> 00:45:47,081
Pub.

527
00:45:51,293 --> 00:45:52,545
Very muddy pub.

528
00:45:55,632 --> 00:45:56,632
Jesus.

529
00:45:59,010 --> 00:46:00,219
What is wrong with you?

530
00:46:07,893 --> 00:46:09,103
Just checking you're here.

531
00:46:10,021 --> 00:46:11,146
Where else would I be?

532
00:46:23,784 --> 00:46:24,994
Ben?

533
00:46:33,753 --> 00:46:35,255
Shit!

534
00:46:35,922 --> 00:46:38,967
No. No, no, no, no.

535
00:46:52,355 --> 00:46:53,773
Think I should call Urs?

536
00:46:54,356 --> 00:46:57,568
Why?
She's barely phoning it in these days.

537
00:47:03,282 --> 00:47:04,367
What's wrong?

538
00:47:04,451 --> 00:47:05,827
I don't wanna go in.

539
00:47:05,911 --> 00:47:09,748
Um, just call Grace and-and get her
to meet us at the end of the road.

540
00:47:09,831 --> 00:47:11,498
No, I will not.

541
00:47:11,583 --> 00:47:14,251
Just put your party hats on and be normal.

542
00:47:26,097 --> 00:47:29,266
Put your party hat on. Please.

543
00:47:29,768 --> 00:47:30,976
Please!

544
00:47:33,771 --> 00:47:34,773
Ow.

545
00:47:35,898 --> 00:47:37,317
And your party face.

546
00:47:41,612 --> 00:47:42,864
That's better.

547
00:47:42,947 --> 00:47:45,699
- Oh, shit.
- What the fuck?

548
00:47:45,784 --> 00:47:48,411
- Grace!
- Grace!

549
00:47:51,914 --> 00:47:53,625
Wha... What?

550
00:47:54,333 --> 00:47:55,835
What?

551
00:47:55,918 --> 00:47:58,630
John Paul is dead.
He's dead, Eva. He's dead.
