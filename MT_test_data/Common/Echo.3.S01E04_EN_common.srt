1
00:01:13,617 --> 00:01:16,620
We have to decide how we're
going to kill this bitch.

2
00:01:16,703 --> 00:01:19,205
I know Fami's death
affected you deeply.

3
00:01:19,789 --> 00:01:21,041
It hurt us all.

4
00:01:21,124 --> 00:01:24,169
We can figure it out when
we get to the compound.

5
00:01:24,252 --> 00:01:27,380
Let's kill her, record it and
see if that makes an impact.

6
00:01:27,464 --> 00:01:28,798
Let's do it now!

7
00:01:34,888 --> 00:01:35,889
Let's go!

8
00:01:36,556 --> 00:01:37,556
Vámonos.

9
00:02:37,409 --> 00:02:38,618
Go.

10
00:03:03,602 --> 00:03:06,062
A little step. One more.

11
00:03:12,569 --> 00:03:13,778
Go.

12
00:03:34,549 --> 00:03:35,926
I got Amber!

13
00:04:48,415 --> 00:04:49,958
Relax.

14
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:53,461
You made the right
decision not to kill her.

15
00:04:58,758 --> 00:05:01,094
Let her rot in there.
It's worse than death.

16
00:05:54,272 --> 00:05:56,816
We know where they
are taking her.

17
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,110
A cocaine place full
of Venezuelan army.

18
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,367
They killed my men.

19
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:07,911
They have to be
punished, and they will.

20
00:06:07,994 --> 00:06:09,746
But the General is right.

21
00:06:09,829 --> 00:06:12,082
We cannot engage on
this side of the border.

22
00:06:40,777 --> 00:06:42,696
Attacking a facility on
this side of the border,

23
00:06:42,779 --> 00:06:45,865
so closely tied to the
Venezuelan government,

24
00:06:47,033 --> 00:06:48,827
would be seen as an act of war.

25
00:06:50,036 --> 00:06:53,832
As Colombian Army, this is
as far as we can go for now.

26
00:06:55,917 --> 00:06:58,461
It's time to go home and
face the politicians.

27
00:07:00,672 --> 00:07:01,715
Let's go.

28
00:07:02,674 --> 00:07:03,842
I'm staying.

29
00:07:03,925 --> 00:07:06,720
By yourself? That's
not a good idea.

30
00:07:07,387 --> 00:07:11,349
I can't go back without
her. You know that.

31
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,280
Good luck.

32
00:07:28,408 --> 00:07:29,492
Thank you.

33
00:08:31,888 --> 00:08:33,181
Rápido.

34
00:09:52,719 --> 00:09:53,887
I had her, Dad.

35
00:09:55,096 --> 00:09:58,433
In my arms. So close.

36
00:09:59,976 --> 00:10:02,354
I could feel her
breathing on my back.

37
00:10:10,737 --> 00:10:11,905
I can imagine.

38
00:10:19,746 --> 00:10:20,830
She's brilliant.

39
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:25,210
She's the purest
soul I ever met.

40
00:10:30,715 --> 00:10:31,800
She's a liar.

41
00:10:32,968 --> 00:10:34,094
She is a liar.

42
00:10:37,305 --> 00:10:41,184
That's a big lie,
working for the CIA.

43
00:10:43,061 --> 00:10:47,399
It's not like, you know, lying
about some old boyfriend's big dick.

44
00:10:53,697 --> 00:10:55,323
I don't know how you trust that.

45
00:10:59,869 --> 00:11:01,079
Reminds me of the…

46
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:11,381
wisdom of one of my
mentors, Kenny Rogers.

47
00:11:13,341 --> 00:11:16,219
You got to know when to hold 'em

48
00:11:16,303 --> 00:11:18,388
Know when to fold 'em

49
00:11:19,681 --> 00:11:22,350
Know when to walk away

50
00:11:26,146 --> 00:11:27,939
Know when to run.

51
00:12:03,016 --> 00:12:04,351
Come on.

52
00:12:06,436 --> 00:12:07,646
Go on.

53
00:12:14,027 --> 00:12:15,027
Yeah.

54
00:12:43,473 --> 00:12:45,600
I'm in pain too, but
instead of thinking of that,

55
00:12:45,684 --> 00:12:48,770
all you can do is revert
to your redneck loyalty.

56
00:12:48,853 --> 00:12:52,065
You promised me when we got
married you wouldn't do this shit.

57
00:12:52,148 --> 00:12:54,901
She's got a side thing she's
doing for the Agency down there.

58
00:12:54,985 --> 00:12:56,069
Special status.

59
00:12:56,152 --> 00:12:58,029
I've been all around the world.

60
00:12:58,113 --> 00:13:01,324
You guys are both fucking liars.

61
00:13:01,408 --> 00:13:04,995
They could hold her for 20 years
or they could kill her tomorrow.

62
00:13:05,078 --> 00:13:09,624
You gotta know when to hold
'em Know when to fold 'em

63
00:13:14,963 --> 00:13:16,882
Know when to walk away

64
00:13:19,801 --> 00:13:21,344
Know when to run.

65
00:16:02,088 --> 00:16:03,089
All right, talk to me.

66
00:16:03,173 --> 00:16:04,799
So the book on that place

67
00:16:04,883 --> 00:16:08,887
says it's like FedEx for the Venezuelan
drug cartel run by the military.

68
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:11,306
It's called Cartel de los
Soles, the Cartel of Suns,

69
00:16:11,389 --> 00:16:12,766
which, if you
didn't already know,

70
00:16:12,849 --> 00:16:16,061
is run all the way to the top
of the Venezuelan government.

71
00:16:16,144 --> 00:16:17,312
Security is strong.

72
00:16:17,395 --> 00:16:19,676
That's army on the outside if
you haven't already noticed.

73
00:16:20,023 --> 00:16:22,418
Also, I feel the need to point out
that that's where they pay out ELN,

74
00:16:22,442 --> 00:16:23,878
so there's gonna be
guerrillas hanging around.

75
00:16:23,902 --> 00:16:26,196
– Blah, blah, blah.
– Those guys are no joke.

76
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:28,114
I can knock it over
in a couple of months.

77
00:16:28,198 --> 00:16:31,034
How? There's no support within
the administration on this.

78
00:16:31,117 --> 00:16:33,495
The White House doesn't
even wanna hear about her.

79
00:16:33,578 --> 00:16:36,539
They won't engage, no
matter what any of us do.

80
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:39,417
So, what about Ground Branch?

81
00:16:39,501 --> 00:16:45,340
No appetite. It's gonna sound harsh, man,
but not every problem has a solution.

82
00:16:45,423 --> 00:16:47,509
I'll tell you another
problem without a solution.

83
00:16:47,592 --> 00:16:50,220
When you wake up one morning
with a Glock in your mouth.

84
00:16:50,303 --> 00:16:52,556
You notice I said
"Glock," not "cock?"

85
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:53,765
And let me tell you,

86
00:16:53,848 --> 00:16:57,477
it won't feel good when that bullet opens
up your fucking skull like a watermelon.

87
00:16:57,561 --> 00:16:59,401
That would be very
traumatizing for my husband.

88
00:16:59,437 --> 00:17:01,314
– Oh, yeah.
– Listen, I'm not giving up.

89
00:17:01,398 --> 00:17:06,026
Seventh floor is aware and concerned,
but for the moment, you're on your own.

90
00:17:26,423 --> 00:17:28,257
Shall we order in tonight?

91
00:17:28,341 --> 00:17:29,821
Cleaned up enough
messes for one day.

92
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,095
Talk to me.

93
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,561
It's Amber.

94
00:17:40,645 --> 00:17:43,899
They're forcing me to
bury her. Bambi too.

95
00:17:43,982 --> 00:17:46,610
What? What do you
mean? Where is she?

96
00:17:47,611 --> 00:17:50,906
In some Venezuelan
hellhole. A drug facility.

97
00:17:52,115 --> 00:17:54,242
He's wandering around
like a lost dog.

98
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:57,120
Well, you can't do that.

99
00:17:59,623 --> 00:18:00,999
Amber's our friend.

100
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:04,961
And Bambi, Jesus Christ,
Mitch, he saved your life.

101
00:18:05,045 --> 00:18:07,589
I mean, you gotta
get him outta there.

102
00:18:08,256 --> 00:18:10,008
Come on. It's not
some eternal debt.

103
00:18:12,177 --> 00:18:15,388
Pretty sure he can take care
of himself. He's fucking Rambo.

104
00:18:21,728 --> 00:18:25,315
She knew the risks. It's
what she signed up for.

105
00:18:26,775 --> 00:18:30,904
You've known her for 15 years. Amber's
not just a friend. She's family.

106
00:18:30,987 --> 00:18:33,490
I'm just as upset
about this as you are.

107
00:18:34,199 --> 00:18:36,076
There's nothing I can do, David.

108
00:18:36,868 --> 00:18:40,747
Is everybody in your
life just an asset?

109
00:18:41,831 --> 00:18:42,749
Am I?

110
00:18:42,832 --> 00:18:46,878
Look, I have a job, and my job is
to consider the biggest picture.

111
00:18:46,962 --> 00:18:49,548
And in the big picture,
it's easier if she stays.

112
00:18:49,631 --> 00:18:51,383
I'm sorry to say it, but it is.

113
00:18:55,011 --> 00:18:58,765
The longer she stays in that prison, the
clearer it becomes how awful Maduro is

114
00:18:58,848 --> 00:19:00,183
when it comes to human rights!

115
00:19:00,267 --> 00:19:04,062
And you're being a
careerist weasel!

116
00:19:04,145 --> 00:19:07,482
Wow. Must be nice to be able
to take the moral high ground?

117
00:19:08,525 --> 00:19:10,402
Make you feel all
warm and cozy inside.

118
00:19:10,485 --> 00:19:13,613
You know, I'd love to be up there too,
but unfortunately, I took an oath.

119
00:19:13,697 --> 00:19:15,865
Yeah. I know all about it.

120
00:19:15,949 --> 00:19:17,367
No, no. You'll listen.

121
00:19:17,867 --> 00:19:19,578
The oath I took for my job?

122
00:19:20,662 --> 00:19:24,332
What was it? Let's see.
Hard to remember. Oh, yeah.

123
00:19:24,874 --> 00:19:28,753
Defend this country against all
enemies, foreign and domestic.

124
00:19:28,837 --> 00:19:31,047
Bear true faith and
allegiance to the same.

125
00:19:31,131 --> 00:19:32,924
I take this obligation freely,

126
00:19:33,008 --> 00:19:36,761
without any mental reservation, et
cetera, et cetera, so help me, God.

127
00:19:39,681 --> 00:19:42,684
It doesn't say jack shit in
there about being a good person.

128
00:20:49,251 --> 00:20:51,731
Now I don't want you to get the
wrong idea about me or nothing,

129
00:20:51,795 --> 00:20:52,921
but…

130
00:20:55,215 --> 00:20:56,216
I'm not a drunk.

131
00:20:56,299 --> 00:20:58,969
It's okay. Jesus doesn't judge.

132
00:21:02,472 --> 00:21:04,224
I've saved some people.

133
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:08,436
Lot of people owe their lives.

134
00:21:10,939 --> 00:21:12,107
And they like me.

135
00:21:25,245 --> 00:21:26,705
Are you DEA?

136
00:21:29,874 --> 00:21:32,127
Do I look like I give
a shit about cocaine?

137
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,885
I was a soldier.

138
00:21:41,136 --> 00:21:43,054
– A soldier?
– Long time ago.

139
00:21:43,138 --> 00:21:44,848
What do you do now?

140
00:21:50,896 --> 00:21:52,188
I'm in tourism.

141
00:21:53,857 --> 00:21:56,318
People wanna see the
authentic Colombia.

142
00:21:57,694 --> 00:21:59,029
For the sunsets.

143
00:22:01,948 --> 00:22:03,450
Landscapes.

144
00:22:05,452 --> 00:22:07,954
You know, people, they
look at this forest

145
00:22:08,038 --> 00:22:12,208
and they go, "How
beautiful." "How beautiful?"

146
00:22:14,753 --> 00:22:18,423
I just see trees and plants, all
fighting each other for the sunlight.

147
00:22:20,467 --> 00:22:23,762
All of them just racing
to the top of the canopy.

148
00:22:26,097 --> 00:22:27,807
And then the slow
growers, they just…

149
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:31,978
die in the shade.

150
00:22:32,687 --> 00:22:36,858
"Let not your hearts be troubled.
Neither let them be afraid."

151
00:22:40,445 --> 00:22:42,489
That's John. Right?

152
00:22:43,156 --> 00:22:45,033
Anyway, it was somewhere, but…

153
00:22:46,243 --> 00:22:47,661
You're a believer.

154
00:22:50,163 --> 00:22:51,164
That's great.

155
00:22:51,248 --> 00:22:53,792
Well, God or the Devil.

156
00:22:54,793 --> 00:22:56,920
Depends which side
of the gun you're on.

157
00:22:57,003 --> 00:22:58,880
You're gonna fucking learn!

158
00:23:03,134 --> 00:23:04,135
I don't know.

159
00:23:06,179 --> 00:23:08,223
I've killed too
many men in my life.

160
00:23:08,306 --> 00:23:10,350
Stay fucking down!

161
00:23:10,433 --> 00:23:12,227
I've told you about
wearing those shorts!

162
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:13,311
Shut up!

163
00:23:14,854 --> 00:23:17,190
Stay the fuck down!

164
00:23:17,274 --> 00:23:18,984
See what I'm saying?

165
00:23:20,652 --> 00:23:22,487
I was eight. You know?

166
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,200
You know what?

167
00:23:28,285 --> 00:23:31,288
I'm a pretty good shot.

168
00:23:32,163 --> 00:23:35,458
Wanna know the
secret? Repeatability.

169
00:23:36,209 --> 00:23:41,715
You gotta hold the weapon the
exact same way every time.

170
00:23:43,466 --> 00:23:45,677
Fuck it, you're gonna learn now!

171
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,928
You're gonna fucking learn...

172
00:23:47,971 --> 00:23:48,972
Yes.

173
00:23:53,852 --> 00:23:55,103
You're a protector.

174
00:23:58,315 --> 00:24:00,442
Your family must be
really happy to have you.

175
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:11,411
Let's sleep together.

176
00:24:14,456 --> 00:24:15,999
I should make you a hamburger.

177
00:24:33,016 --> 00:24:34,017
You know what?

178
00:24:36,186 --> 00:24:37,812
I should've played baseball.

179
00:24:38,813 --> 00:24:41,608
I had a 72-mile-an-hour
fastball when I was 14.

180
00:24:45,862 --> 00:24:47,280
That's really good, by the way.

181
00:24:57,457 --> 00:24:59,292
Finish outside.

182
00:25:01,044 --> 00:25:03,255
Go. Go play baseball outside.

183
00:25:43,879 --> 00:25:45,505
Finally.

184
00:27:13,843 --> 00:27:15,136
How did I get here?

185
00:27:16,346 --> 00:27:17,764
I found you in the street.

186
00:27:18,974 --> 00:27:20,684
Well, thank you for rescuing me.

187
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,106
I didn't think I'd made such
a good first impression.

188
00:27:31,069 --> 00:27:32,112
You hungry?

189
00:27:38,034 --> 00:27:39,035
It's…

190
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,624
From my cousin, Javi.
He's a fisherman.

191
00:27:50,005 --> 00:27:53,466
"Follow me and I will
make you fishers of men."

192
00:28:29,961 --> 00:28:31,880
Where does he get so much fish?

193
00:28:31,963 --> 00:28:35,592
Next to the bridge, where
the current slows down.

194
00:28:36,718 --> 00:28:37,969
By the big bridge?

195
00:28:38,053 --> 00:28:40,847
Yes, but you can't go there.

196
00:28:41,765 --> 00:28:45,477
Fishermen are very
territorial, especially Javi.

197
00:29:00,033 --> 00:29:01,034
Buenos días.

198
00:29:09,417 --> 00:29:10,418
Buenos días.

199
00:29:14,923 --> 00:29:17,300
This is where I fish, my friend.

200
00:29:17,884 --> 00:29:21,763
You want me to swim over to the
other side and fish from Venezuela?

201
00:29:23,014 --> 00:29:24,558
That's not my problem, man.

202
00:29:27,686 --> 00:29:29,271
Aren't rivers for everyone?

203
00:29:32,857 --> 00:29:34,568
This is where the
currents converge.

204
00:29:35,944 --> 00:29:38,738
A man must fish
where the fish are.

205
00:29:47,038 --> 00:29:48,623
A man has to be careful.

206
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:51,918
This is my spot.

207
00:29:55,505 --> 00:30:00,635
Well, how about you take
all the fish that I get,

208
00:30:02,304 --> 00:30:03,889
and you just give
me ten dollars?

209
00:30:21,281 --> 00:30:22,532
What's your name?

210
00:30:22,616 --> 00:30:23,617
Javi.

211
00:30:26,328 --> 00:30:27,412
Me llamo Bambi.

212
00:30:31,374 --> 00:30:32,626
It's funny, right?

213
00:30:33,501 --> 00:30:34,920
I'm gonna make you rich.

214
00:30:35,545 --> 00:30:37,547
Rich? How?

215
00:30:38,089 --> 00:30:39,174
– How?
– Yeah.

216
00:30:40,759 --> 00:30:41,801
With money.

217
00:30:44,721 --> 00:30:45,722
Good.

218
00:30:47,307 --> 00:30:49,309
– See you tomorrow.
– Mañana.

219
00:30:49,976 --> 00:30:51,561
Mañana, amigo.

220
00:31:09,287 --> 00:31:10,705
Okay.

221
00:31:10,789 --> 00:31:11,873
Do you know what?

222
00:31:11,957 --> 00:31:15,377
– What? Tell me.
– Cumbia is the best music in the world.

223
00:31:24,094 --> 00:31:25,428
Look at this.

224
00:32:03,508 --> 00:32:05,468
– Salud.
– Good. Good job.

225
00:32:13,059 --> 00:32:14,269
Let's have beer.

226
00:32:43,256 --> 00:32:45,926
We got five million in the
campaign exploratory account.

227
00:32:46,009 --> 00:32:48,220
That's ten times what
anybody else has.

228
00:32:48,303 --> 00:32:51,431
We got some heavy hitters coming
in. Lot of White House experience.

229
00:32:51,514 --> 00:32:52,950
You're gonna have
big guns behind you.

230
00:32:52,974 --> 00:32:53,975
Right. Good.

231
00:32:54,601 --> 00:32:56,728
What's the matter? Your
head still in Colombia?

232
00:32:57,187 --> 00:32:58,980
I know you gotta
be torn up inside.

233
00:32:59,064 --> 00:33:00,190
Let's not do that.

234
00:33:00,273 --> 00:33:02,150
– What?
– Talk about emotion.

235
00:33:02,234 --> 00:33:03,235
Okay, tough guy.

236
00:33:04,444 --> 00:33:08,573
But you need to understand
she is not coming out. Ever.

237
00:33:08,657 --> 00:33:09,824
We did the research.

238
00:33:10,533 --> 00:33:11,910
I spoke to the White House.

239
00:33:11,993 --> 00:33:17,791
It is very sad. I liked her a
lot, but she is not coming home.

240
00:33:19,626 --> 00:33:22,879
Well, now it's time to move
to the grown-ups' table

241
00:33:22,963 --> 00:33:27,092
and make some decisions about your life
before life makes the decisions for you.

242
00:33:27,884 --> 00:33:29,469
I'll do my best
to make you happy.

243
00:33:31,638 --> 00:33:32,847
Christ.

244
00:33:35,141 --> 00:33:36,768
When did you get so cynical?

245
00:33:37,352 --> 00:33:39,813
I don't know. Maybe at Harvard.

246
00:33:41,439 --> 00:33:43,942
It's fine. I just
wanted to be clear.

247
00:33:44,693 --> 00:33:46,319
No, maybe you're right.

248
00:33:47,153 --> 00:33:51,032
Maybe everybody's just, you know,
operating out of self-interest.

249
00:33:51,116 --> 00:33:53,118
Maybe family is just some…

250
00:33:53,201 --> 00:33:58,373
sentimental construct to justify
some heartless animal kingdom crap.

251
00:33:58,456 --> 00:34:01,877
Maybe real love doesn't exist at
all, but I want you to remember,

252
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:04,838
I taught you how to
wipe your own ass.

253
00:34:04,921 --> 00:34:07,841
I had your shit on my fingers.

254
00:34:07,924 --> 00:34:11,469
And if you think that wasn't out of
love, you need to grow the fuck up.

255
00:34:12,762 --> 00:34:16,057
Cynicism is a refuge for
the young and the childless.

256
00:34:25,442 --> 00:34:26,610
Too much?

257
00:34:27,861 --> 00:34:28,862
No.

258
00:34:30,697 --> 00:34:33,700
Senator, I hope we
didn't keep you waiting.

259
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,036
Outside of the development team,

260
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:38,038
you're gonna be the
first to know about this.

261
00:34:38,121 --> 00:34:41,082
– If you don't like it, I'll be devastated.
– Well, it's not up to me.

262
00:34:41,166 --> 00:34:43,519
Let's see where the warfighters
put it on their list of priorities.

263
00:34:43,543 --> 00:34:45,146
Speaking of which, we
have one right here.

264
00:34:48,256 --> 00:34:51,760
I wasn't expecting to see you.
We're all very sorry for your loss.

265
00:34:51,843 --> 00:34:52,844
Thank you.

266
00:34:57,182 --> 00:35:01,895
My father... dad, does not
know what I'm about to say.

267
00:35:01,978 --> 00:35:03,313
I'm intrigued.

268
00:35:05,815 --> 00:35:08,276
I've been exploring a run for
the Senate seat opening up.

269
00:35:09,736 --> 00:35:11,655
Could we talk
about your support?

270
00:35:11,738 --> 00:35:13,657
I would love to talk
to you about it.

271
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:18,495
That's how you make history,
kids. Got a future president here.

272
00:35:18,578 --> 00:35:20,455
Senator, I know
your time is short.

273
00:35:20,538 --> 00:35:21,998
Reese, wanna kick it off?

274
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:26,169
Senator, may we
introduce you to Ulysses?

275
00:35:45,355 --> 00:35:47,065
You feel it in your bones.

276
00:35:47,857 --> 00:35:50,944
When that call comes in,
it's the tone of voice,

277
00:35:51,027 --> 00:35:53,321
and you know something
bad has happened.

278
00:35:54,489 --> 00:35:58,743
When you hear, "Your
wife has been kidnapped."

279
00:36:00,745 --> 00:36:03,206
And it has shattered your core,

280
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:07,836
and makes you mad at God, and
you say, "How can God be good?"

281
00:36:09,087 --> 00:36:11,756
And then you segue.
People like vulnerability.

282
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:16,636
And you take the lessons
that life has given you.

283
00:36:17,262 --> 00:36:18,471
Everybody has loss.

284
00:36:19,598 --> 00:36:22,392
Some people's loss
is worse than yours.

285
00:36:22,475 --> 00:36:26,771
I think about a woman who's lost her
child because of substandard medical care,

286
00:36:26,855 --> 00:36:29,316
and I know that I
wanna fight her fight.

287
00:36:30,358 --> 00:36:35,989
And along with that is the importance
of stronger national security.

288
00:36:36,865 --> 00:36:41,620
Americans should be free to travel
safely all around the globe.

289
00:36:42,454 --> 00:36:47,167
And when anyone threatens that,
they should fear our wrath.

290
00:36:49,252 --> 00:36:52,297
Make it your own, of course,
but something like that.

291
00:37:20,825 --> 00:37:22,535
Hey, Boss. You got a sec?

292
00:37:25,747 --> 00:37:27,082
Got a confession to make.

293
00:37:27,582 --> 00:37:28,875
You got five minutes.

294
00:37:29,459 --> 00:37:32,504
So, our hero gets picked up by
jungle bros we know are ELN.

295
00:37:32,587 --> 00:37:34,297
Okay, you can assume
I paid attention.

296
00:37:34,381 --> 00:37:38,718
Right. They drop her off in this
facility run by the Venezuelan military.

297
00:37:38,802 --> 00:37:40,720
That suggests to me they
consider her a keeper.

298
00:37:40,804 --> 00:37:44,474
Chit for sanctions, propaganda.
Maybe they don't know yet.

299
00:37:44,558 --> 00:37:46,935
So, what's your confession?

300
00:37:47,561 --> 00:37:52,691
Well, Amber's been good to the Agency,
and I'm personally tight with her brother.

301
00:37:52,774 --> 00:37:54,901
He's done a lot of
favors for us in Iraq.

302
00:37:54,985 --> 00:37:57,625
On the one hand, we have loyalty
and our integrity as human beings.

303
00:37:58,238 --> 00:38:00,949
On the other hand, the price of
loyalty, in this case, is very high.

304
00:38:01,032 --> 00:38:03,243
So there's an upside to
cutting ties right now.

305
00:38:03,326 --> 00:38:05,161
But I still don't see
how it's my problem.

306
00:38:05,245 --> 00:38:06,997
Well, I'm trying one last idea.

307
00:38:08,582 --> 00:38:10,792
We could help Bambi
knock the place over.

308
00:38:12,377 --> 00:38:14,004
Don't put any of
this on my desk.

309
00:39:53,144 --> 00:39:54,145
Hey.

310
00:40:29,222 --> 00:40:30,515
It's not a good time.

311
00:40:32,559 --> 00:40:33,977
You're scared. It's cool.

312
00:40:40,984 --> 00:40:41,985
Can I be rough?

313
00:40:42,068 --> 00:40:43,403
I don't know, can you?

314
00:40:44,905 --> 00:40:47,365
Is it "yes," or is it "no?"

315
00:40:48,575 --> 00:40:49,659
Yeah.

316
00:40:59,085 --> 00:41:00,086
I changed my mind.

317
00:41:01,463 --> 00:41:04,299
What the fuck are we
doing? This is bullshit.

318
00:41:06,593 --> 00:41:07,594
It's not.

319
00:41:08,762 --> 00:41:11,306
I was pretty clear
about my motivations.

320
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:15,518
You're going through a lot 'cause
you're injured and your wife's in hell,

321
00:41:15,602 --> 00:41:18,813
and that, I'm here to be the
companion in the hard times.

322
00:41:18,897 --> 00:41:21,942
Well, thank you,
but I don't need it.

323
00:41:23,818 --> 00:41:25,028
And I don't want it.

324
00:41:26,446 --> 00:41:29,532
What about me? What
about what I want?

325
00:41:36,122 --> 00:41:39,125
– You're so handsome.
– Jesus.

326
00:41:39,209 --> 00:41:40,710
– Do you always do that?
– What?

327
00:41:40,794 --> 00:41:43,129
Just push away compliments?

328
00:41:43,213 --> 00:41:45,882
When they spring from
ulterior motives, yeah.

329
00:41:47,842 --> 00:41:50,178
Handsome but so sensitive.

330
00:41:50,262 --> 00:41:52,347
Trust me, nobody
has ever said that.

331
00:41:55,725 --> 00:41:58,853
Well, maybe the people in your life
don't really see you for who you are.

332
00:41:59,354 --> 00:42:02,983
I'm an outside observer here,
but yeah, you're sensitive,

333
00:42:03,942 --> 00:42:06,653
and you're just trying
really hard not to show it.

334
00:42:08,196 --> 00:42:12,951
Come on. Empathy.
Psychological insight.

335
00:42:15,161 --> 00:42:18,081
And now I'm literally
on my knees for you.

336
00:42:20,667 --> 00:42:23,753
You have to admit, it's
a pretty strong offer.
