1
00:00:15,891 --> 00:00:18,853
It took me a long time
and some hard lessons

2
00:00:18,937 --> 00:00:23,733
to learn what I know
about love, fate, and chasing redemption.

3
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:31,199
But it started with a simple choice,

4
00:00:31,283 --> 00:00:33,493
escape or die.

5
00:00:35,996 --> 00:00:37,956
Back in here at one o'clock, you bludgers.

6
00:00:41,459 --> 00:00:43,219
– Yeah, yeah.
– I know.

7
00:00:54,389 --> 00:00:56,850
– Ooh, here he comes.
– Hello, doggy.

8
00:01:02,021 --> 00:01:04,355
– You're in trouble now, mate.
– Dead man!

9
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:07,694
You're gonna get yours, dog.

10
00:01:11,448 --> 00:01:12,740
You're a dead man.

11
00:01:22,292 --> 00:01:24,418
They let Barnes out of the slot.

12
00:01:28,381 --> 00:01:30,132
He's got friends in high places,
hasn't he?

13
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,927
I'm not ready.

14
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:35,305
Dale, would you just forget
about escaping?

15
00:01:35,388 --> 00:01:37,473
Tell that bloody cop
what he wants to know.

16
00:01:37,557 --> 00:01:40,143
And then what? I'm not a dog, Ned.

17
00:01:40,227 --> 00:01:44,438
Well, every fucking convict out there
already thinks that you are.

18
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:48,151
Shit, Barnes,
he almost killed you last time, didn't he?

19
00:01:50,653 --> 00:01:53,365
What, you think
he's just gonna not finish the job?

20
00:02:00,371 --> 00:02:03,792
– Fuck it. I'm going now.
– You're what?

21
00:02:07,128 --> 00:02:09,420
Dale! What about me?

22
00:02:10,382 --> 00:02:11,758
You gotta take me with you.

23
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:20,678
Dale. Dale!

24
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:24,391
It's nearly one o'clock.
It's never gonna work with these things.

25
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:26,768
Dale, we've gotta go back.

26
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,644
Dale, listen to me!

27
00:04:28,728 --> 00:04:31,021
We can get back onto the wing
before the next count.

28
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:40,281
There's a buzz saw downstairs.

29
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,951
– No. They'll know it was missing.
– Or they won't.

30
00:04:47,663 --> 00:04:49,374
– It won't work.
– It will work.

31
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:52,586
Because they'd never think a convict
would be stupid enough to use a power saw

32
00:04:52,668 --> 00:04:54,211
to escape over the front wall.

33
00:04:54,295 --> 00:04:57,382
And they'd be bloody well right.
Fuck this, man. We have to go back.

34
00:04:58,007 --> 00:04:59,466
Mate, I can't go back.

35
00:05:53,271 --> 00:05:55,231
– Come on, come on.
– You four.

36
00:06:56,459 --> 00:06:57,627
Fuck.

37
00:07:33,704 --> 00:07:36,081
Stay tight. They can't see us from here.

38
00:07:36,165 --> 00:07:37,207
Okay.

39
00:07:44,757 --> 00:07:46,091
How high is it?

40
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:48,637
– Thirty, 40 feet, maybe.
– Uh-huh.

41
00:07:49,637 --> 00:07:51,389
We could bloody break our legs.

42
00:07:52,932 --> 00:07:55,935
– Move.
– Dale, I'm scared of heights.

43
00:07:56,019 --> 00:07:57,812
You're gonna be fine, mate.

44
00:08:00,774 --> 00:08:03,985
You know what? You go, all right?
I'm gonna go back, but you go.

45
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:08,447
– For fuck's sake. Calm down.
– Just let me go. I can't fucking do this.

46
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,619
You can't go back.
'Cause then they're gonna know I'm gone.

47
00:08:13,286 --> 00:08:17,624
– Yeah b...
– Hey, yeah. Mate, you're going first.

48
00:08:30,136 --> 00:08:31,137
Fuck.

49
00:09:38,163 --> 00:09:41,040
In that moment,
I was waiting for the rifle shot.

50
00:09:43,043 --> 00:09:44,919
I didn't dare think I might be free.

51
00:10:22,331 --> 00:10:23,582
The cops been here?

52
00:10:24,167 --> 00:10:25,460
No.

53
00:10:26,586 --> 00:10:28,212
Where did you go before coming here?

54
00:10:28,296 --> 00:10:29,338
I didn't.

55
00:10:30,673 --> 00:10:31,716
Not to your mother?

56
00:10:33,802 --> 00:10:35,470
That's the first place they'd be waiting.

57
00:10:36,388 --> 00:10:38,974
I was the next person you thought of. Why?

58
00:10:39,057 --> 00:10:40,100
I don't know.

59
00:10:41,225 --> 00:10:43,937
I didn't give it much thought.
I just jumped the wall and got away.

60
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:46,605
I didn't have much of a plan beyond that.

61
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:50,527
Well, I'm sure you have friends who can be
much more use in your current situation.

62
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:52,696
Practically, I mean, to a fugitive.

63
00:10:54,697 --> 00:10:56,198
You're not my student anymore, Dale.

64
00:10:56,283 --> 00:10:58,701
And I'm not in the business
of helping escaped convicts.

65
00:10:58,784 --> 00:11:00,202
Sir, I had to escape.

66
00:11:00,287 --> 00:11:04,039
They were gonna kill me in there.
I really didn't have a choice.

67
00:11:04,124 --> 00:11:05,708
Choice is all you have.

68
00:11:08,628 --> 00:11:12,048
I mean, I can't go back to college.
I can't be a paramedic.

69
00:11:13,341 --> 00:11:14,801
There's not much left.

70
00:11:21,474 --> 00:11:26,354
I was so proud…
…of getting out of where I came from,

71
00:11:28,315 --> 00:11:30,024
of how proud my mum was…

72
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:34,236
proud of what you saw in me.

73
00:11:35,071 --> 00:11:36,822
And now look at me.

74
00:11:36,907 --> 00:11:38,991
I'm a failed student, a failed son…

75
00:11:45,331 --> 00:11:46,917
You're better than all those things.

76
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,251
No.

77
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:53,881
No, I know what I did…

78
00:11:56,301 --> 00:11:57,677
what I need to pay for.

79
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:02,890
Dying in prison
wasn't gonna make it right.

80
00:12:02,974 --> 00:12:07,645
You haven't escaped anything
unless you go on to something, so…

81
00:12:10,273 --> 00:12:11,649
what do you want to be?

82
00:12:12,359 --> 00:12:15,361
I wanna be the man I was gonna be
before all of this.

83
00:12:15,445 --> 00:12:18,365
You can't. Not here. Not anymore.

84
00:12:23,745 --> 00:12:25,038
Then I have to leave.

85
00:12:37,551 --> 00:12:38,552
Why?

86
00:12:38,634 --> 00:12:40,720
Because I know who you really are.

87
00:12:41,303 --> 00:12:44,515
And I think you came here
to have someone remind you of it.

88
00:12:49,812 --> 00:12:51,022
No more guns, Dale.

89
00:12:52,856 --> 00:12:54,359
No more armed robberies or heroin.

90
00:12:55,777 --> 00:12:57,320
Don't you make me into a fool.

91
00:13:19,509 --> 00:13:22,095
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Bombay.

92
00:13:22,177 --> 00:13:24,014
While opening the overhead compartments…

93
00:13:24,096 --> 00:13:25,472
– Go. Go on.
– …please take care.

94
00:13:29,686 --> 00:13:31,855
The first thing I noticed was the smell.

95
00:13:32,938 --> 00:13:35,859
In that first Bombay minute,
I didn't recognize it.

96
00:13:35,942 --> 00:13:39,904
But I do now. It was the smell of hope.

97
00:13:39,988 --> 00:13:41,631
– Next.
– Ladies and gentlemen,

98
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:43,908
welcome to Bombay International Airport…

99
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:47,578
But standing there
with another man's name and fake passport,

100
00:13:47,662 --> 00:13:50,915
hope and fear felt much the same.

101
00:15:09,034 --> 00:15:10,870
Good morning, sir!

102
00:15:10,953 --> 00:15:12,913
I am number one guide in Bombay.

103
00:15:12,998 --> 00:15:16,250
I know everything there is to know
about my golden city.

104
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:19,169
You are in need of assistance?
I can show you everything.

105
00:15:20,588 --> 00:15:23,508
– Hey... Thank you, but no.
– Sir, let me assist you, sir.

106
00:15:24,091 --> 00:15:25,217
Yes, sir.

107
00:15:25,302 --> 00:15:28,513
But forgive me, sir,
this was only a one-time no, huh?

108
00:15:28,596 --> 00:15:31,640
And here in my India,
a one-time no is not a true no.

109
00:15:31,725 --> 00:15:33,809
Yeah? So what's a true no?

110
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:37,563
Only after three noes, it is a true no.

111
00:15:38,606 --> 00:15:41,985
Please, sir, allow me
to show you cheap, clean hotel.

112
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:43,778
And after, you decide what to pay.

113
00:15:43,861 --> 00:15:45,404
What if I decide to pay nothing?

114
00:15:45,488 --> 00:15:47,740
Then that is your choice, sir.

115
00:15:47,823 --> 00:15:49,826
But I don't believe
it's a choice you'll be making.

116
00:15:49,909 --> 00:15:52,245
I am number one guide in Bombay.

117
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:59,376
Yes, sir. Very big, sir. Everyone agrees.
You are knowing me too well.

118
00:15:59,461 --> 00:16:01,701
– Ah, you want to see our merch?
– No.

119
00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:03,840
Sir.

120
00:16:04,716 --> 00:16:05,716
Myself, Prabhu.

121
00:16:07,927 --> 00:16:08,928
Lindsay.

122
00:16:09,011 --> 00:16:10,679
– Lin-see.
– Lindsay.

123
00:16:10,764 --> 00:16:13,015
Lin-see. Sir, don't mind, huh?

124
00:16:13,099 --> 00:16:15,936
But…
…this is a not-so-good name.

125
00:16:20,231 --> 00:16:24,068
It is too long and squeaky
for, uh, how Indian people speak.

126
00:16:24,152 --> 00:16:26,192
– Okay.
– I think short name, short name.

127
00:16:26,238 --> 00:16:28,030
– That's...
– "Lin" is better.

128
00:16:28,114 --> 00:16:30,658
– Yeah, no problem.
– You do not object? I can call you Lin?

129
00:16:30,741 --> 00:16:32,118
– Uh, Lin's fine.
– Very good.

130
00:16:32,201 --> 00:16:33,870
Also, it has a very lucky meaning.

131
00:16:33,953 --> 00:16:36,163
– Oh, yeah? What's that?
– "Great penis."

132
00:16:37,915 --> 00:16:39,125
Great penis?

133
00:16:39,209 --> 00:16:41,836
It is not meaning this exactly,
but it is sounding like ling,

134
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:43,754
and that is meaning, "great big penis."

135
00:16:48,342 --> 00:16:51,096
it is full power name, too lucky name.

136
00:16:51,178 --> 00:16:54,599
Everyone will love this name
when they hear it. You'll see.

137
00:17:00,813 --> 00:17:01,898
Okay, you win.

138
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:04,608
Show me a hotel.

139
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,405
Sir, come, sir.

140
00:17:16,704 --> 00:17:17,997
You like?

141
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:28,090
I like.

142
00:17:30,509 --> 00:17:32,429
Where are you coming from?

143
00:17:35,723 --> 00:17:36,849
New Zealand.

144
00:18:18,224 --> 00:18:19,683
How's that working for you?

145
00:18:21,228 --> 00:18:23,980
That why we're here, to debate philosophy?

146
00:18:25,565 --> 00:18:27,901
What, you think you're too clever for me,
do you, Dale?

147
00:18:27,983 --> 00:18:30,028
I'm just a dumb policeman.

148
00:18:30,111 --> 00:18:32,822
But years of experience
has given me a philosophy

149
00:18:33,448 --> 00:18:36,867
based on, uh, you know, empiric research

150
00:18:37,451 --> 00:18:42,539
that, just like day follows night,
every man succumbs to his nature,

151
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:44,834
even a smart boy like you.

152
00:18:45,626 --> 00:18:47,045
You think your mother's proud?

153
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:50,131
I was watching her in the courtroom,
blaming herself.

154
00:18:51,048 --> 00:18:54,051
– Well, you broke her heart.
– Don't talk about her.

155
00:18:54,677 --> 00:18:58,682
You know why you are worse
than all the scumbags in here?

156
00:18:59,473 --> 00:19:01,684
Because you had
the chance to be different.

157
00:19:02,269 --> 00:19:06,565
All the advantages she worked so hard
to give you, and yet here you are.

158
00:19:06,647 --> 00:19:09,192
And a good man is dead.

159
00:19:09,276 --> 00:19:11,111
Who killed Officer Floris?

160
00:19:11,944 --> 00:19:13,529
Give me the name.

161
00:19:14,823 --> 00:19:16,324
Come on, mate.

162
00:19:21,037 --> 00:19:22,705
I can't remember.

163
00:19:27,544 --> 00:19:28,586
You will.

164
00:19:47,105 --> 00:19:50,650
Wake up, Linbaba!
I have so much to show you.

165
00:20:01,243 --> 00:20:04,204
Should we take this
white motherfucker the long way round?

166
00:20:11,086 --> 00:20:12,297
Chai also.

167
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,381
– I pay?
– Mmm.

168
00:20:14,507 --> 00:20:16,652
How long
has this motherfucker been in town?

169
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,280
What is this "maderchod?"

170
00:20:19,346 --> 00:20:20,387
Oh, "motherfucker."

171
00:20:20,471 --> 00:20:22,973
Very good curse, Linbaba.
Everyone is using it.

172
00:20:30,856 --> 00:20:31,857
Bloody hell!

173
00:20:33,609 --> 00:20:34,778
Is he fucking mad?

174
00:20:42,535 --> 00:20:43,994
And if we stop for lunch…

175
00:20:45,121 --> 00:20:47,790
How much do you charge
this white motherfucker?

176
00:20:47,874 --> 00:20:49,459
Who are you calling "motherfucker?"

177
00:21:13,023 --> 00:21:15,777
I was a wanted man
with a price on my head,

178
00:21:15,859 --> 00:21:18,363
on the run with no home and no country.

179
00:21:19,405 --> 00:21:21,074
But for now, I was free.

180
00:21:22,157 --> 00:21:24,286
Every day on the run is your whole life.

181
00:21:24,952 --> 00:21:27,038
And there's hope and excitement
in the new.

182
00:21:27,122 --> 00:21:28,498
I don't really need any fabric.

183
00:21:28,582 --> 00:21:31,417
You know, I'll come back maybe tomorrow.
Tomorrow. Tomorrow.

184
00:22:00,029 --> 00:22:01,448
You're lucky I was here.

185
00:22:05,326 --> 00:22:07,162
Maybe you're my guardian angel.

186
00:22:09,873 --> 00:22:11,665
There's too much devil in me for that.

187
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:15,377
– How much devil are we talking?
– Hey, Karla! Come on.

188
00:22:16,003 --> 00:22:18,923
If you come to Reynaldo's sometime,
maybe you'll get to find out.

189
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,761
Oh, Karla!

190
00:22:26,138 --> 00:22:28,474
– Who is this?
– You made a new friend?

191
00:22:36,398 --> 00:22:39,944
You found it then. I'm Karla Saaranen.

192
00:22:40,737 --> 00:22:43,365
Lindsay Ford. People call me Lin.

193
00:22:44,115 --> 00:22:45,532
They do?

194
00:22:45,616 --> 00:22:47,868
Yeah, I'm aware of
the whole "great penis" thing.

195
00:22:47,952 --> 00:22:49,453
Just "penis," no "great."

196
00:22:49,537 --> 00:22:52,749
Just means, you know, everyday,
average, kind of…

197
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:56,001
All right.

198
00:22:56,086 --> 00:22:59,256
Beware her riddles
and her seductions, young man.

199
00:23:00,714 --> 00:23:02,592
– Didier Levy.
– Lindsay Ford.

200
00:23:06,555 --> 00:23:08,431
– Were you leaving?
– Yeah? Just got here.

201
00:23:08,515 --> 00:23:11,476
Then why on earth are we standing?

202
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:12,852
Come. Join us.

203
00:23:13,394 --> 00:23:15,438
You can stand to eat a meal if you must.

204
00:23:15,521 --> 00:23:20,234
You can stand to make love if you're able,
but it's impossible to stand and drink.

205
00:23:20,317 --> 00:23:22,612
It's the act of a barbarian,

206
00:23:22,695 --> 00:23:25,699
an animal at the watering hole.

207
00:23:29,618 --> 00:23:30,619
…the same.

208
00:23:30,703 --> 00:23:33,539
Reynaldo's was an unofficial free zone,

209
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:36,917
scrupulously ignored by the local police.

210
00:23:38,586 --> 00:23:40,797
Didier was a permanent fixture,

211
00:23:40,881 --> 00:23:44,593
putting together buyers and sellers of
anything that could earn him a commission.

212
00:23:45,218 --> 00:23:48,346
But strict rules apply to
all the business conducted there.

213
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:52,726
Deals for drugs and contraband
were openly transacted at the tables,

214
00:23:53,309 --> 00:23:56,563
but these agreements could only be sealed
on the pavement outside.

215
00:23:58,022 --> 00:24:00,650
Hookers, dealers, gamblers and gangsters.

216
00:24:01,151 --> 00:24:04,153
Men who might kill each other any day
and knew it.

217
00:24:04,237 --> 00:24:07,740
But, in Reynaldo's,
no blood was ever spilt.

218
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,703
Dangerous man, that one. Rafiq.

219
00:24:12,787 --> 00:24:14,580
He used to run a black market in books.

220
00:24:15,457 --> 00:24:17,625
– Books?
– Passports.

221
00:24:17,709 --> 00:24:20,086
Rafiq is bitter
about losing his book business.

222
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:21,462
Men were killed.

223
00:24:24,924 --> 00:24:27,301
– What about that guy?
– The victor.

224
00:24:27,384 --> 00:24:28,845
Abdullah Taheri.

225
00:24:29,346 --> 00:24:33,599
He works for Abdel Khader Khan,
one of the great crime lords of the city.

226
00:24:33,682 --> 00:24:35,352
Didier, you talk too much.

227
00:24:48,865 --> 00:24:53,244
What, are you expecting
many serious injuries here in Bombay,

228
00:24:53,327 --> 00:24:54,537
huh, Linbaba?

229
00:24:55,413 --> 00:24:58,250
Force of habit. I was an ambo back home.

230
00:24:58,916 --> 00:25:01,211
– Ambo?
– I drove an ambulance.

231
00:25:02,796 --> 00:25:04,881
Better w-we pretend you're a doctor.

232
00:25:05,673 --> 00:25:07,634
We could be making
so much money like this.

233
00:25:07,717 --> 00:25:10,220
Many patients I could bring you
for a small commission.

234
00:25:10,303 --> 00:25:11,971
Better we don't mention it at all.

235
00:25:27,695 --> 00:25:31,407
Very cool, these sunglasses.
Like Amitabh in Trishul.

236
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:32,576
Don't do that.

237
00:25:32,659 --> 00:25:33,993
It's style, boss.

238
00:25:34,618 --> 00:25:36,078
Do you wanna swap?

239
00:25:42,294 --> 00:25:47,048
But... In all honesty,
these are cheap and not so good.

240
00:25:48,383 --> 00:25:49,968
Do you want them or not?

241
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,596
Why you do this?

242
00:25:54,138 --> 00:25:55,307
Because you're my mate.

243
00:26:03,022 --> 00:26:04,916
– What?
– I walked here barefoot

244
00:26:04,941 --> 00:26:06,276
'cause a guy came in my shoes.

245
00:26:07,443 --> 00:26:09,505
He looked totally straight,
then I went into the bathroom.

246
00:26:13,157 --> 00:26:14,491
Oh, my God.

247
00:26:14,576 --> 00:26:15,576
Ugh, Lisa.

248
00:26:18,663 --> 00:26:20,266
– Mmm, poor darling.
– How do I wear them now?

249
00:26:22,375 --> 00:26:24,336
Lisa was an old friend of Karla's.

250
00:26:24,961 --> 00:26:28,173
Somehow sad and sexy as hell
all at the same time.

251
00:26:28,256 --> 00:26:29,507
Crazy people love me.

252
00:26:32,259 --> 00:26:33,940
Have I told you to get fucked yet, Didier?

253
00:26:41,685 --> 00:26:44,314
You should do an interview, Lisa.
Anonymous, of course.

254
00:26:44,396 --> 00:26:47,776
– Yes.
– People will be fascinated by your story.

255
00:26:47,858 --> 00:26:50,278
They will be fascinated
by the man who came in her shoes?

256
00:26:50,362 --> 00:26:52,780
– Yeah.
– Who would read this, Kavvie?

257
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:56,242
Vikram Khanna was a Bollywood stuntman.

258
00:26:56,326 --> 00:26:58,286
His sister Kavita was a journalist.

259
00:26:58,369 --> 00:27:01,580
Smart and ambitious
and eager to make her mark.

260
00:27:02,499 --> 00:27:04,125
What brings you to Bombay, Lin?

261
00:27:06,126 --> 00:27:07,461
Tell her nothing, Lin.

262
00:27:07,546 --> 00:27:10,173
In Bombay,
everyone's story is their own to keep,

263
00:27:10,257 --> 00:27:11,883
which drives Kavvie crazy.

264
00:27:16,512 --> 00:27:20,267
Wherever Lisa went, her pimps
Maurizio and Modena

265
00:27:20,349 --> 00:27:22,852
– were never far away.
– This is Lin. He's from New Zealand.

266
00:27:22,935 --> 00:27:25,063
Lin, Maurizio and Modena.

267
00:27:25,689 --> 00:27:26,690
Lin.

268
00:27:28,232 --> 00:27:30,652
Means "prick" in Hindi, right?

269
00:27:34,573 --> 00:27:38,742
It takes a prick to know one.

270
00:27:39,368 --> 00:27:41,328
My grandmother was from Padova.

271
00:27:45,916 --> 00:27:49,296
Any other languages we should know about,
just to avoid further embarrassment?

272
00:27:49,378 --> 00:27:51,964
I swear pretty good
in Marathi and Hindi these days.

273
00:27:53,133 --> 00:27:57,304
I can even speak
fluent American if the occasion demands.

274
00:27:57,386 --> 00:28:00,265
It's pretty good. Do some more.

275
00:28:01,348 --> 00:28:03,618
Well, I'm not asking you to forgive me.

276
00:28:03,643 --> 00:28:05,769
I'll never understand or forgive myself.

277
00:28:05,854 --> 00:28:09,691
And if a bullet gets me, so help me,
I'll laugh at myself for being an idiot.

278
00:28:09,773 --> 00:28:14,820
But there's one thing I do know.
That is that I love you, Scarlett.

279
00:28:14,904 --> 00:28:16,698
Wow.

280
00:28:17,949 --> 00:28:21,536
– Arre, do Clint Eastwood. Can you?
– Yeah. Yeah.

281
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:24,955
"Well,
you gotta ask yourself one question."

282
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:26,374
"Do I feel lucky?"

283
00:28:27,166 --> 00:28:29,044
"Well, do you, punk?"

284
00:28:30,921 --> 00:28:33,423
– What is...
– It's Dirty Harry.

285
00:28:39,471 --> 00:28:41,406
Is that Clint?
If it's not a Western, I'm not seeing it.

286
00:28:41,431 --> 00:28:43,224
You should be an actor or something, Lin.

287
00:28:43,807 --> 00:28:45,393
And we should have dinner sometime.

288
00:28:45,477 --> 00:28:48,145
You can talk American to me all night.
I'd like that.

289
00:28:48,646 --> 00:28:49,730
Bye, bye, bye.

290
00:28:50,397 --> 00:28:52,192
– Ciao, Maurizio.
– Ciao.

291
00:28:52,275 --> 00:28:54,736
– Oh, nice, nice. Ciao, Maurizio.
– Bye.

292
00:28:58,323 --> 00:29:01,403
– He didn't look happy, yaar.
– I think you embarrassed him.

293
00:29:13,296 --> 00:29:17,509
Those first few weeks, I watched
all of the seekers come and then leave,

294
00:29:17,592 --> 00:29:19,176
heading for the "real India,"

295
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:23,222
seeking enlightenment and solitude
and self-contemplation.

296
00:29:24,057 --> 00:29:26,017
But I'd had my share of that forced on me.

297
00:29:29,186 --> 00:29:32,356
Instead, Bombay felt exhilaratingly free,

298
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,358
a place where everyone started new.

299
00:29:34,942 --> 00:29:37,403
And I responded to that with all my heart.

300
00:29:38,654 --> 00:29:40,155
You should get out of Bombay, Lin.

301
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:44,286
This is the place they were thinking about
when they invented the word "the pits."

302
00:29:45,202 --> 00:29:47,247
You should go to Varanasi or Rajasthan.

303
00:29:47,329 --> 00:29:49,540
I don't know. I like it here.

304
00:29:49,624 --> 00:29:53,752
And perhaps Bombay offers our Lin
things he won't find anywhere else.

305
00:29:54,336 --> 00:29:55,588
N'est-ce pas?

306
00:30:06,599 --> 00:30:08,643
Give this to Karla for me?

307
00:30:08,727 --> 00:30:11,730
Tell her I said not to worry.
I'm a big girl.

308
00:30:14,732 --> 00:30:17,652
– Ciao, Didier. Lin.
– Oh, Maurizio.

309
00:30:17,736 --> 00:30:20,154
Andiamo. We don't want
to keep Madame Zhou waiting, hmm?

310
00:30:29,873 --> 00:30:31,290
What's that all about?

311
00:30:32,834 --> 00:30:35,002
In matters of food, I am French.

312
00:30:35,086 --> 00:30:36,880
In matters of love, I am Italian.

313
00:30:36,962 --> 00:30:40,299
But in matters of business, I am Swiss,

314
00:30:40,383 --> 00:30:44,304
strictly neutral,
especially with other people's business.

315
00:30:44,386 --> 00:30:45,846
And I advise you to be the same.

316
00:30:52,394 --> 00:30:54,271
Now, if you'll excuse me,

317
00:30:54,355 --> 00:30:58,108
I see a man who might be
of great consequence to my fortunes.

318
00:30:58,192 --> 00:30:59,903
Bonne chance, Lin.

319
00:31:04,574 --> 00:31:08,077
– Something I said?
– No, he's just got business to attend to.

320
00:31:09,828 --> 00:31:13,333
– Looked like your meeting went well?
– It did, actually. Very well.

321
00:31:14,917 --> 00:31:17,671
You just missed Lisa.
She gave me something for you.

322
00:31:18,296 --> 00:31:19,548
Walk with me?

323
00:31:36,064 --> 00:31:38,732
I like that you haven't asked
what this is for.

324
00:31:39,942 --> 00:31:41,443
None of my business.

325
00:31:41,528 --> 00:31:43,947
Yet here you are. How come?

326
00:31:46,449 --> 00:31:48,951
Lisa asked. I like her.

327
00:31:50,953 --> 00:31:54,124
Well, Lisa would spend all her money
on dope if I let her.

328
00:31:54,874 --> 00:31:57,794
I told her she needs to save some
in case she ever needs it.

329
00:31:57,877 --> 00:31:59,336
I hold it for her.

330
00:31:59,421 --> 00:32:01,338
– "Fuck you money."
– Exactly.

331
00:32:02,173 --> 00:32:03,383
She'll never use it.

332
00:32:04,509 --> 00:32:09,055
Even more than the heroin,
Lisa needs to feel looked after,

333
00:32:09,638 --> 00:32:12,601
even if it's by men like Maurizio
who get her into trouble.

334
00:32:13,351 --> 00:32:14,894
Maybe she'll surprise you one day.

335
00:32:15,936 --> 00:32:18,647
I doubt it. She is what she is.

336
00:32:21,817 --> 00:32:23,444
You don't think people can change?

337
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:27,740
They have to want to.

338
00:32:29,659 --> 00:32:33,038
I think life's like a crowded lifeboat.

339
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:36,499
Maybe you throw out your pride
to stay afloat,

340
00:32:37,625 --> 00:32:39,752
maybe your self-respect
and your independence.

341
00:32:43,882 --> 00:32:46,884
friends, everyone you used to know,
and it's still not enough.

342
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:51,513
The boat is still sinking,
and you're going down with it.

343
00:32:51,597 --> 00:32:53,807
That's Lisa.
She'll never get out of the boat.

344
00:33:02,275 --> 00:33:03,902
You're a good listener.

345
00:33:04,611 --> 00:33:07,404
That's dangerous
because it's so hard to resist.

346
00:33:07,489 --> 00:33:08,615
Being listened to...

347
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,034
Really listened to...

348
00:33:12,035 --> 00:33:13,077
It's rare.

349
00:33:13,744 --> 00:33:15,372
Makes a person feel special.

350
00:33:23,672 --> 00:33:27,259
Okay, now you're taking
this good-listener thing a little too far.

351
00:33:38,644 --> 00:33:41,230
…for business interests
from the West and here in Bombay.

352
00:33:42,022 --> 00:33:44,651
And then I realized
if I was the one making the deals happen,

353
00:33:44,733 --> 00:33:46,236
why not make them happen myself.

354
00:33:47,069 --> 00:33:50,323
Bombay is changing fast.
There's a lot of money to be made here.

355
00:33:51,532 --> 00:33:52,951
Is money what you want?

356
00:33:53,034 --> 00:33:55,869
What I want is to be master
of my own destiny.

357
00:33:56,704 --> 00:33:58,498
Money gives you that freedom.

358
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:03,961
Have I disappointed you, Lin?

359
00:34:06,256 --> 00:34:08,300
No. No, not at all.

360
00:34:10,467 --> 00:34:13,972
I think freedom is all you can ask for,
however you find it.

361
00:34:16,141 --> 00:34:18,268
What does your freedom look like?

362
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:24,900
To be able to choose where to be,
what to do…

363
00:34:27,027 --> 00:34:28,110
with who.

364
00:34:29,905 --> 00:34:31,072
Then I'm honored.

365
00:34:37,661 --> 00:34:38,746
This is me.

366
00:34:42,333 --> 00:34:45,295
I'm sorry to have kept you so late.

367
00:34:45,378 --> 00:34:46,963
You should grab a taxi. I'll pay.

368
00:34:48,005 --> 00:34:51,467
I'll walk.
Good way to get to know the city.

369
00:34:55,639 --> 00:35:01,603
Then thank you,
for this and for walking with me.

370
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:03,646
I enjoyed it.

371
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:06,023
Yeah, me too.

372
00:35:24,876 --> 00:35:26,085
Fuck.

373
00:35:54,489 --> 00:35:56,365
– Come here.
– Hey!

374
00:35:58,284 --> 00:35:59,452
Where are you going?

375
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:05,666
Nowhere. Just a tourist.
I got a little bit turned around.

376
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:07,878
Hey, it's past curfew.

377
00:36:09,003 --> 00:36:10,672
There's a curfew?

378
00:36:10,755 --> 00:36:12,590
Show us your papers.

379
00:36:12,673 --> 00:36:14,217
Show your passport.

380
00:36:33,402 --> 00:36:36,739
Look, breaking curfew, very bad.

381
00:36:38,115 --> 00:36:39,844
– I think you should go to jail.
– Ah, come...

382
00:36:39,867 --> 00:36:41,952
Hey! Would you like to go to jail, gora?

383
00:36:44,289 --> 00:36:45,289
No.

384
00:36:46,206 --> 00:36:48,835
I think you would not like
to go to jail at all, Mr…

385
00:38:33,231 --> 00:38:34,940
Listen, I'm leaving Bombay.

386
00:38:36,735 --> 00:38:37,902
It's time I moved on.

387
00:38:39,445 --> 00:38:40,487
Where?

388
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:43,782
I don't know. Goa maybe? Varanasi?

389
00:38:43,867 --> 00:38:45,911
– When?
– Tomorrow. This'll be our last day.

390
00:38:45,994 --> 00:38:50,123
Yeah, yeah. These places all the goras
are going to, I don't think you'll like.

391
00:38:50,206 --> 00:38:52,541
– Can't stay here forever.
– No, I know this.

392
00:38:53,126 --> 00:38:55,128
But you should go
to a real Indian village, na?

393
00:38:56,045 --> 00:38:57,047
Listen.

394
00:38:57,588 --> 00:38:58,840
I'm listening.

395
00:38:58,923 --> 00:39:02,844
If you are wanting,
I could take some time from my schedule

396
00:39:03,385 --> 00:39:04,804
and take you to my village.

397
00:39:06,139 --> 00:39:09,434
I've never offered to take a gora before,
but you are my good friend.

398
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:18,275
One train, two bus rides.
It is beautiful there.

399
00:39:19,527 --> 00:39:20,903
You'll come, na?

400
00:39:23,782 --> 00:39:24,949
I would be honored.

401
00:39:26,326 --> 00:39:28,411
And I will charge
same as Bombay only, huh?

402
00:39:28,494 --> 00:39:29,788
One hundred rupees a day.

403
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:37,628
Hey, very generous of you to offer, Lin.
I accept.

404
00:39:45,512 --> 00:39:47,137
– Who is it?
– Karla.

405
00:40:06,074 --> 00:40:07,324
Laundry day?

406
00:40:08,201 --> 00:40:09,202
Yep.

407
00:40:10,786 --> 00:40:12,204
I'm leaving town.

408
00:40:13,248 --> 00:40:14,623
Were you gonna say goodbye?

409
00:40:16,333 --> 00:40:18,420
Yeah, I was gonna
come by Reynaldo's tonight.

410
00:40:21,755 --> 00:40:22,757
Come in.

411
00:40:25,719 --> 00:40:26,969
These are quite something.

412
00:40:29,014 --> 00:40:31,349
Yeah. Tough paper round.

413
00:40:33,518 --> 00:40:34,561
What's going on?

414
00:40:36,438 --> 00:40:38,981
I was hoping you'd maybe help me
with something.

415
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:41,650
Okay.

416
00:40:43,862 --> 00:40:46,364
Lisa's in a really bad situation.

417
00:40:46,447 --> 00:40:49,826
Maurizio convinced her
to work in a brothel called the Palace.

418
00:40:50,994 --> 00:40:53,954
It isn't good. It caters for all tastes.

419
00:40:54,039 --> 00:40:57,666
And Madame Zhou, the woman
who runs the place, is pretty scary.

420
00:40:59,418 --> 00:41:00,753
What about Maurizio?

421
00:41:01,338 --> 00:41:04,215
Maurizio doesn't give a shit
about anyone but himself.

422
00:41:05,592 --> 00:41:10,679
Parker was coming with me to demand
Lisa's release as an American citizen.

423
00:41:17,978 --> 00:41:19,271
Sounds like a good plan.

424
00:41:19,356 --> 00:41:22,192
It was, until Parker left town.

425
00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:30,282
I can't stand the idea
of Lisa being prisoner in that place.

426
00:41:31,534 --> 00:41:35,871
And then I thought of you
doing your accents the other day.

427
00:41:35,956 --> 00:41:37,666
Lisa said you were pretty good.

428
00:41:38,708 --> 00:41:40,710
And you thought
I could pretend to be this guy?

429
00:41:41,335 --> 00:41:42,545
Yeah.

430
00:41:44,838 --> 00:41:49,052
I... Look, Karla, I'm sorry, but… I can't.

431
00:41:49,802 --> 00:41:50,804
You could.

432
00:41:51,637 --> 00:41:54,474
I mean, you're not just some tourist
out to see the world, Lin,

433
00:41:54,557 --> 00:41:56,016
or I wouldn't be here.

434
00:41:57,059 --> 00:41:58,894
Maybe that's why I can't get involved.

435
00:42:00,605 --> 00:42:02,690
Everyone here is running away
from something.

436
00:42:02,773 --> 00:42:04,985
Yeah, I know.
And I plan to keep right on going.

437
00:42:05,068 --> 00:42:09,489
It doesn't work. Trust me.
You can be free of anything but yourself.

438
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:13,076
You don't know anything about me.

439
00:42:15,494 --> 00:42:17,664
But I thought
there was something worth knowing.

440
00:42:18,206 --> 00:42:19,331
Guess I was wrong.

441
00:42:35,431 --> 00:42:37,434
One way or another,
you're gonna say the words.

442
00:42:37,516 --> 00:42:38,976
So let's just get to it, huh?

443
00:42:39,561 --> 00:42:42,396
Who pulled the trigger?

444
00:42:43,106 --> 00:42:44,565
I'm not a dog.

445
00:42:45,358 --> 00:42:47,610
I'm here to be punished for what I did.

446
00:42:47,693 --> 00:42:51,197
No, no, no.
Doesn't fucking work like that.

447
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,032
You don't get to feel better.

448
00:42:53,617 --> 00:42:55,994
Punishment is punishment. Pain is pain.

449
00:43:00,664 --> 00:43:03,208
This isn't a path to a better place, kid.
Huh?

450
00:43:03,293 --> 00:43:04,793
This is all you've got coming.

451
00:43:05,461 --> 00:43:07,588
There's no redemption
for the likes of you.

452
00:43:26,233 --> 00:43:28,902
Don't you knock? Even just once?

453
00:43:30,070 --> 00:43:32,364
We must go and collect
our train tickets for tomorrow now.

454
00:43:32,447 --> 00:43:34,365
This way, no last-minute problems.

455
00:43:34,449 --> 00:43:38,119
Also, we must buy gifts
for everyone in my village.

456
00:43:38,202 --> 00:43:39,204
Everyone?

457
00:43:42,414 --> 00:43:44,793
Help me! Help me!

458
00:43:48,963 --> 00:43:51,233
– This is not our business, Lin.
– Let's go. Lin!

459
00:43:51,257 --> 00:43:53,842
– Please. Help me.
– Let me see. Let me see.

460
00:43:53,927 --> 00:43:55,530
– When was the last time he shot?
– He's dying!

461
00:43:55,554 --> 00:43:56,989
– When was the last time?
– I don't know.

462
00:43:57,012 --> 00:43:58,865
– Give me some room.
– Somebody call the police.

463
00:43:58,889 --> 00:44:01,016
Lin, this is not our problem.
It is very bad business.

464
00:44:01,101 --> 00:44:03,329
– When did he last shoot?
– It is best we are not involved!

465
00:44:03,353 --> 00:44:06,021
– Lin, let's go!
– An hour? I don't know.

466
00:44:07,773 --> 00:44:09,358
Lin, the police are coming!

467
00:44:16,032 --> 00:44:20,286
No! Come back! Come back!

468
00:44:27,418 --> 00:44:28,878
You know, I could've saved him.

469
00:44:30,547 --> 00:44:32,340
I've treated overdoses before.

470
00:44:32,423 --> 00:44:33,925
Where are you taking him?

471
00:44:34,009 --> 00:44:36,427
I don't know, Linbaba.
He was looking pretty dead to me.

472
00:44:36,927 --> 00:44:38,471
I could have fucking tried.

473
00:44:39,472 --> 00:44:41,016
It's nothing to do with me.

474
00:44:44,059 --> 00:44:46,521
– You have to come with us now.
– I don't wanna come with you.

475
00:44:46,605 --> 00:44:47,731
What's the point, Prabhu,

476
00:44:49,565 --> 00:44:52,318
being here, of any of it,
if all I am is scared?

477
00:44:56,739 --> 00:44:58,490
What is it that you are scared of, Lin?

478
00:45:10,336 --> 00:45:11,713
I gotta do something.

479
00:45:11,795 --> 00:45:13,757
Hey, Lin,
we are leaving tomorrow early, yaar.

480
00:45:17,135 --> 00:45:20,054
Look, go get the train tickets.

481
00:45:20,137 --> 00:45:22,514
I'll be back here tomorrow.
We'll leave as planned.

482
00:45:24,726 --> 00:45:26,228
Right now, I gotta be somewhere.

483
00:45:32,442 --> 00:45:34,860
– Who is it?
– It's me. Lin.

484
00:45:40,282 --> 00:45:42,409
– I'll do it.
– What?

485
00:45:42,994 --> 00:45:43,994
Lisa.

486
00:45:46,914 --> 00:45:48,583
If we can go tonight, I'll do it.

487
00:45:48,666 --> 00:45:51,027
Either way, I'm leaving Bombay
first thing tomorrow morning.

488
00:45:52,128 --> 00:45:53,255
What changed?

489
00:45:58,760 --> 00:45:59,969
Come here.

490
00:46:10,605 --> 00:46:11,773
Choose something smart.

491
00:46:13,233 --> 00:46:15,318
You've got a lot of men's clothes.

492
00:46:15,402 --> 00:46:17,653
The last two guys
who lived here left suddenly.

493
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:20,407
And didn't take their gear?

494
00:46:20,489 --> 00:46:23,201
One of them was breaking the law.
He had to leave in a hurry.

495
00:46:26,871 --> 00:46:28,331
I'll leave you to it.

496
00:46:38,757 --> 00:46:39,842
Fits you well.

497
00:46:41,927 --> 00:46:44,097
So what happened
to the other guy who lived here?

498
00:46:45,306 --> 00:46:46,307
He died.

499
00:46:48,101 --> 00:46:50,228
Whose suit is this?
The bad guy, or the dead guy?

500
00:46:50,728 --> 00:46:54,106
I bought it for Ahmed to be buried in.
In the end, we didn't use it.

501
00:46:54,190 --> 00:46:55,650
Fuck me, Karla.

502
00:46:55,733 --> 00:46:59,153
Don't tell me you're superstitious.
A man like you?

503
00:47:00,572 --> 00:47:02,657
What does that mean? A man like me?

504
00:47:04,199 --> 00:47:06,911
I don't know. Isn't that the point?

505
00:47:13,626 --> 00:47:15,003
Who do you report to?

506
00:47:17,213 --> 00:47:20,217
Counselor
for Political Affairs, Arlen Hayes.

507
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:21,509
Your hometown?

508
00:47:28,807 --> 00:47:30,268
Donald... Donald Gable.

509
00:47:43,907 --> 00:47:47,702
Rumor is, Zhou is the former mistress
of a KGB officer.

510
00:47:47,786 --> 00:47:49,996
But people say
a lot of weird stuff about her.

511
00:47:51,206 --> 00:47:55,543
Bottom line, she is smart,
vindictive and dangerous.

512
00:47:56,503 --> 00:47:59,588
Lisa wouldn't be the first girl
to disappear from the Palace.

513
00:48:19,693 --> 00:48:21,652
How do you know so much about her?

514
00:48:22,362 --> 00:48:25,574
I get paid to make deals happen.
Some of them happened here.

515
00:48:31,704 --> 00:48:33,123
Fuck me.

516
00:48:51,724 --> 00:48:53,018
Ram ram, Miss Karla.

517
00:48:53,601 --> 00:48:54,603
Padma.

518
00:48:55,896 --> 00:48:57,646
Sir, if you please, your business card.

519
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:05,739
Mr. Parker. Karla knows the way.

520
00:49:24,632 --> 00:49:25,675
Ready?

521
00:49:45,237 --> 00:49:46,947
Is this your American?

522
00:49:50,074 --> 00:49:53,202
Gilbert Parker, with the American Embassy.

523
00:49:54,161 --> 00:49:58,291
This is not an official visit.
At least not this time, anyway.

524
00:49:59,125 --> 00:50:01,628
– You are here doing a favor?
– Yes.

525
00:50:03,045 --> 00:50:05,297
– For you.
– I don't think so.

526
00:50:06,132 --> 00:50:07,634
Are you in love, Mr. Parker?

527
00:50:08,927 --> 00:50:11,596
– What?
– I fear you are in love with our Karla.

528
00:50:12,681 --> 00:50:15,809
Is that how she got you to do
this little job of work for her?

529
00:50:18,728 --> 00:50:23,108
I'm here because I was told an American
citizen is being held against her will.

530
00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:26,860
Don't think for a minute
that Karla will ever love you in return.

531
00:50:27,612 --> 00:50:32,117
I tell you this, Mr. Parker,
as my favor to you.

532
00:50:34,159 --> 00:50:38,498
Duly noted. Now, where's Lisa Carter?

533
00:50:38,581 --> 00:50:40,875
Mmm. Lisa is where she is happy to be.

534
00:50:41,585 --> 00:50:44,920
Well, then bring her out
and let her tell me that herself.

535
00:50:48,090 --> 00:50:49,675
I don't think so.

536
00:50:53,679 --> 00:50:55,764
Let's go. This is a waste of time.

537
00:51:04,648 --> 00:51:08,235
Your business is with me, not her.

538
00:51:09,278 --> 00:51:12,072
You don't look or talk
much like a diplomat.

539
00:51:14,034 --> 00:51:18,246
No. No, I work out of the embassy.

540
00:51:19,204 --> 00:51:20,789
Nobody said I was a diplomat.

541
00:51:21,791 --> 00:51:25,211
My department tends to be
a little more hands-on.

542
00:51:25,795 --> 00:51:26,838
Parker.

543
00:51:29,048 --> 00:51:31,134
So you should get me Lisa Carter.

544
00:51:32,594 --> 00:51:34,971
Because if you fuck with me
for one minute longer,

545
00:51:35,054 --> 00:51:37,097
I will have agents camped
on your doorstep,

546
00:51:37,181 --> 00:51:40,184
taking photographs
of anyone coming in or out.

547
00:51:41,393 --> 00:51:44,898
And I'll make it clear
to the authorities here in Bombay

548
00:51:44,981 --> 00:51:50,027
that the Palace and the US government
are now at war.

549
00:51:55,115 --> 00:51:57,952
Quite the dog you bring
in here on a leash, Karla.

550
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:01,748
Is this about Ahmed and Christina?

551
00:52:03,375 --> 00:52:07,628
Nothing you do will change
the fact they are gone.

552
00:52:13,050 --> 00:52:17,472
If I walk out of here alone,
there's no going back.

553
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:34,905
I agree to your terms, Mr. Parker.

554
00:52:34,989 --> 00:52:36,657
You can take Lisa with you.

555
00:52:37,659 --> 00:52:42,163
I just wonder if Karla will keep her end
of whatever bargain you made.

556
00:53:07,313 --> 00:53:08,731
She's really letting me go?

557
00:53:09,481 --> 00:53:12,693
Mr. Parker here and Madame Zhou
came to an agreement.

558
00:53:14,862 --> 00:53:16,947
Then I guess
I should be thanking Mr. Parker.

559
00:53:18,909 --> 00:53:21,452
Let's get the fuck out of here
before she changes her mind.

560
00:53:30,295 --> 00:53:32,963
What the hell were you thinking,
going after her like that?

561
00:53:47,519 --> 00:53:48,855
I need a fix, Karla.

562
00:53:49,563 --> 00:53:51,942
Zhou cut me off
unless I told you I wanted to stay.

563
00:53:52,525 --> 00:53:55,070
But I knew once you got my message,
you'd come running.

564
00:53:55,612 --> 00:53:56,612
Come here.

565
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:04,411
I'm ready.

566
00:54:05,121 --> 00:54:06,248
I'll quit.

567
00:54:06,998 --> 00:54:08,458
I just have to level off.

568
00:54:16,550 --> 00:54:18,009
Give me the name.

569
00:54:28,269 --> 00:54:29,353
Rujul.

570
00:54:30,355 --> 00:54:32,023
The man I saw was Rujul Aadekar.

571
00:54:38,530 --> 00:54:39,864
It's gonna be okay.

572
00:55:04,014 --> 00:55:05,014
Wait!

573
00:55:07,726 --> 00:55:10,186
Lin, stop! Come on!

574
00:55:11,438 --> 00:55:12,438
Please.

575
00:55:12,521 --> 00:55:14,681
Why? So you can feed me more bullshit
about Madame Zhou

576
00:55:14,733 --> 00:55:16,693
and whatever history you and her have got?

577
00:55:16,775 --> 00:55:19,278
You know, I heard her say
that dead guy's name, Ahmed,

578
00:55:20,947 --> 00:55:22,489
the guy whose suit I was wearing.

579
00:55:24,701 --> 00:55:27,913
– I didn't sign up to feed anyone's habit.
– There's more if you want it.

580
00:55:30,789 --> 00:55:31,791
Fuck you.

581
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:36,588
You know, I heard Lisa in there.

582
00:55:37,838 --> 00:55:40,675
You got her out
so she could give you some name.

583
00:55:42,092 --> 00:55:43,762
Wasn't to rescue her.

584
00:55:43,844 --> 00:55:48,099
And I wonder what you're so guilty about
that playing the hero was this important.

585
00:55:54,940 --> 00:55:58,150
So this was all just some shit you fed me
'cause you knew I'd bite?

586
00:55:58,943 --> 00:56:00,362
We all have secrets, Lin.

587
00:56:01,070 --> 00:56:03,951
I don't wanna know yours because
I have no intention of telling you mine.

588
00:56:05,115 --> 00:56:08,286
But you're right.
I got Lisa out for my own reasons.

589
00:56:08,911 --> 00:56:11,081
But that doesn't change the good you did.

590
00:56:12,331 --> 00:56:13,625
Don't confuse the two.

591
00:56:17,086 --> 00:56:18,838
I hope you find what you need.

592
00:57:38,376 --> 00:57:42,005
I felt like I'd been dropped
straight into deep, dark water.

593
00:57:42,505 --> 00:57:44,507
Everything exploding around me.

594
00:57:56,894 --> 00:57:59,898
I am number one guide in Bombay.
I know everything there is to know…

595
00:57:59,981 --> 00:58:02,775
…touching everyone,
friends and enemies…

596
00:58:12,327 --> 00:58:15,204
changing everyone's lives forever.
