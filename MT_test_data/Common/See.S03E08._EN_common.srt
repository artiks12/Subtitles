1
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:48,133
I can't let him go in alone.

2
00:00:48,216 --> 00:00:50,926
It's too late.
By now, he's already there.

3
00:00:51,427 --> 00:00:54,097
Then we follow.
Kofun, Wren and I can catch up to him.

4
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:57,017
Even if he does kill Sibeth,
how does he think he's gonna get out?

5
00:01:04,608 --> 00:01:06,984
– We have to go.
– Yes.

6
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,403
No.

7
00:01:08,486 --> 00:01:11,864
We have the entire population
of Pennsa inside this tunnel,

8
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:15,409
and we are nowhere near its end yet.

9
00:01:16,286 --> 00:01:18,914
If she starts
hurling her God Thunder again,

10
00:01:18,996 --> 00:01:21,625
this place may very well
become a mass grave.

11
00:01:22,459 --> 00:01:25,712
There was a time to fight,
and that time has passed.

12
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:28,423
But my father is fighting.

13
00:01:29,341 --> 00:01:33,677
Well, let's hope he's doing it
very quietly then.

14
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:37,848
No, thank you.

15
00:01:38,557 --> 00:01:39,850
More for me.

16
00:02:01,248 --> 00:02:04,459
So, do we have an actual plan?

17
00:02:05,668 --> 00:02:07,462
Find the queen and kill her.

18
00:02:10,382 --> 00:02:12,550
That's more of a goal than a plan.

19
00:03:39,971 --> 00:03:42,098
You're gonna frighten people with that.

20
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:46,645
People are already frightened of me.

21
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:51,983
– But not you.
– Well, don't take it personally.

22
00:03:52,067 --> 00:03:55,027
I just don't fear people
the way others do.

23
00:03:56,905 --> 00:03:58,073
Why is that?

24
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:05,038
No. In fact, I was the runt of the litter.

25
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:08,082
But I was smarter than everyone else.

26
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:11,169
Smart enough to know
there were other paths to power.

27
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:16,048
Edo Voss was a giant of a man,

28
00:04:16,132 --> 00:04:18,802
but because of that, he thought too small.

29
00:04:20,637 --> 00:04:23,305
He wanted to use the sighted
to guide his armies.

30
00:04:24,432 --> 00:04:25,660
He didn't even think about the fact

31
00:04:25,684 --> 00:04:28,228
that they could read the books
of our ancestors.

32
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:32,274
Unlock knowledge
that could change the face of warfare.

33
00:04:35,151 --> 00:04:38,737
I spent my entire life searching
for a power

34
00:04:38,822 --> 00:04:42,576
that didn't come from how hard
you could swing your sword.

35
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:48,372
And now here I am,
sitting across from you.

36
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:53,211
Able to destroy entire cities
without an army.

37
00:04:54,754 --> 00:04:57,007
That's something Edo
never even dreamed of.

38
00:04:59,718 --> 00:05:01,595
Which reminds me.

39
00:05:03,012 --> 00:05:05,557
It seems to me we should have heard
from Maghra by now.

40
00:05:06,182 --> 00:05:09,853
At what point do we assume
that she's made other plans?

41
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:12,771
Maghra decides nothing quickly.

42
00:05:14,106 --> 00:05:16,043
No doubt her family is trying
to convince her to fight.

43
00:05:16,067 --> 00:05:19,653
But her twisted sense
of virtue will not be able to resist

44
00:05:19,737 --> 00:05:23,783
the idea of sacrificing her own life
for her people.

45
00:05:28,288 --> 00:05:29,497
Tormada.

46
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:31,249
Yes.

47
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:34,586
Have your bombs ready, just in case.

48
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:36,963
They always are, my queen.

49
00:05:40,132 --> 00:05:42,093
It should be me facing her, not him.

50
00:05:42,593 --> 00:05:44,553
Your sacrifice would earn us nothing

51
00:05:45,055 --> 00:05:46,932
and leave your people without a queen.

52
00:05:47,432 --> 00:05:49,058
So, I must surrender my husband?

53
00:05:49,643 --> 00:05:52,269
If that's what comes with it. Yes.

54
00:05:55,356 --> 00:05:58,985
Maghra. Stay the course. Stay the course.

55
00:06:00,487 --> 00:06:02,697
This moment right here

56
00:06:04,074 --> 00:06:07,160
may very well be
the moment for which you were born.

57
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:21,711
This is her tent. I can smell her.

58
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:24,798
Then where is she?

59
00:08:26,341 --> 00:08:28,175
– My queen.
– You called for me.

60
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:30,095
Ayura, tell her what you hear.

61
00:08:31,512 --> 00:08:32,846
Nothing.

62
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:34,932
Nothing?

63
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:38,226
No voices. No tools.

64
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:41,773
No sizzle of pans or fires in the pits.

65
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,192
No babies crying.

66
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:46,986
Just the muffled sounds of many feet.

67
00:08:47,528 --> 00:08:48,697
Muffled?

68
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,447
Muffled by earth.

69
00:08:51,032 --> 00:08:52,408
They're underground.

70
00:08:52,908 --> 00:08:54,076
Hiding.

71
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:55,370
No. They're walking.

72
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:56,620
A tunnel.

73
00:08:57,121 --> 00:08:58,414
They found a way out.

74
00:09:00,667 --> 00:09:02,376
I do, my queen.

75
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,461
Bomb them.

76
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:07,631
– Kill them!
– Fire!

77
00:09:11,927 --> 00:09:13,346
Fire!

78
00:09:27,777 --> 00:09:29,028
Oh, no.

79
00:09:29,988 --> 00:09:31,197
Fuck.

80
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,282
Come.

81
00:09:45,169 --> 00:09:47,297
– She knows.
– Yes.

82
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:48,673
Keep moving!

83
00:09:52,552 --> 00:09:54,638
I said keep moving!

84
00:10:00,393 --> 00:10:01,727
Anything?

85
00:10:02,437 --> 00:10:03,437
No.

86
00:10:04,188 --> 00:10:05,231
Don't stop.

87
00:10:08,485 --> 00:10:09,903
Fire!

88
00:10:17,118 --> 00:10:18,495
Call it out!

89
00:10:19,578 --> 00:10:21,331
– Ready!
– Ready!

90
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:23,166
Fire!

91
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:37,429
Stop!

92
00:10:43,269 --> 00:10:44,687
– Kofun?
– Wait here.

93
00:11:14,301 --> 00:11:15,342
Kofun.

94
00:11:16,344 --> 00:11:17,511
We have stopped them.

95
00:11:18,304 --> 00:11:19,431
Excellent.

96
00:11:19,931 --> 00:11:21,057
Hit them again.

97
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,652
Kofun?

98
00:11:33,611 --> 00:11:34,946
Yeah?

99
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:39,200
Run! Run!

100
00:11:45,081 --> 00:11:46,415
Kofun!

101
00:11:53,756 --> 00:11:55,008
Kofun!

102
00:12:07,479 --> 00:12:09,272
You, uh, think anybody heard that, Baba?

103
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:14,277
– Who's there?
– Captain?

104
00:12:14,903 --> 00:12:15,986
They're between us!

105
00:12:16,071 --> 00:12:17,447
– New plan?
– New plan.

106
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:19,282
Fight!

107
00:12:26,873 --> 00:12:28,291
Kofun!

108
00:12:36,841 --> 00:12:38,217
You all right?

109
00:12:38,301 --> 00:12:39,885
I'm okay. Nothing's broke.

110
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:41,346
– Are you sure?
– Is Wolffe okay?

111
00:12:45,517 --> 00:12:46,768
We can't go any further.

112
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:50,813
– We can't stay here.
– We'll be buried alive.

113
00:12:59,239 --> 00:13:02,658
If it's come down
to choosing our manner of death,

114
00:13:04,076 --> 00:13:07,831
I'd rather die fighting for our land
than hiding beneath it.

115
00:13:08,956 --> 00:13:10,000
I agree.

116
00:13:11,835 --> 00:13:13,253
I agree.

117
00:13:14,671 --> 00:13:15,672
Me too.

118
00:13:20,885 --> 00:13:22,553
– General.
– What is it?

119
00:13:23,638 --> 00:13:26,474
– Fighting. Within the camp.
– Witchfinders?

120
00:13:26,557 --> 00:13:29,561
Not Witchfinders and not Trivantians.

121
00:13:30,061 --> 00:13:33,648
Two men. One of them is very large.

122
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:35,567
Baba Voss.

123
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:37,192
They've infiltrated the camp.

124
00:13:37,985 --> 00:13:41,072
Sound the alarm! Intruders in the camp!

125
00:13:42,115 --> 00:13:46,870
Intruders in the camp!
Intruders in the camp!

126
00:13:50,373 --> 00:13:53,960
Intruders! Intruders in the camp!

127
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:17,817
They have been through here. Let's go.

128
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,624
Baba, you dead?

129
00:14:33,124 --> 00:14:34,250
No.

130
00:14:34,334 --> 00:14:36,753
– Me neither.
– Head for the bombs.

131
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:44,213
Maghra.

132
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:47,551
– Why would she come now?
– Stop the attack.

133
00:16:48,467 --> 00:16:50,135
She hasn't abided with your terms.

134
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:53,139
My sister is as simple
as she is predictable.

135
00:16:55,808 --> 00:16:59,144
Now she will sacrifice herself
to save what's left of them.

136
00:16:59,229 --> 00:17:02,274
We should continue the attack.
They still have an army.

137
00:17:03,316 --> 00:17:06,902
And in a matter of moments,
it will be our army to command.

138
00:17:06,987 --> 00:17:08,904
– How can you trust that...
– Tormada.

139
00:17:09,446 --> 00:17:12,449
You've come inside me,
and you've bombed a city into submission.

140
00:17:12,534 --> 00:17:15,286
I'd say you're having a good day.
Don't ruin it.

141
00:17:17,247 --> 00:17:18,372
Halt!

142
00:17:22,294 --> 00:17:23,295
Lieutenant Moss!

143
00:17:23,377 --> 00:17:28,090
Every spare soldier should be searching
the camp for intruders!

144
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:29,509
Yes, sir.

145
00:17:30,009 --> 00:17:31,428
You heard him. Fan out.

146
00:17:34,471 --> 00:17:35,723
Maghra.

147
00:17:43,565 --> 00:17:46,483
I'm just sorry that it's come to this.

148
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:48,153
Are you?

149
00:17:50,238 --> 00:17:54,534
I know you think I'm wrong,
but, just like you,

150
00:17:55,535 --> 00:17:58,579
I'm only trying
to do what I feel is right.

151
00:17:58,663 --> 00:18:00,414
By killing innocent citizens?

152
00:18:00,999 --> 00:18:03,751
Don't you ever get tired
of your own self-righteousness?

153
00:18:04,336 --> 00:18:06,587
– I protected you.
– You betrayed me.

154
00:18:06,671 --> 00:18:08,757
That was to protect everyone else.

155
00:18:09,507 --> 00:18:13,510
And round and round we go.

156
00:18:14,346 --> 00:18:15,512
Sibeth.

157
00:18:22,436 --> 00:18:26,023
Let me remind you that you tried
to overthrow me when you were younger.

158
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:27,608
And now you tried again.

159
00:18:28,108 --> 00:18:29,277
And in both cases,

160
00:18:29,361 --> 00:18:31,238
the dire consequences
of your insurrections

161
00:18:36,326 --> 00:18:39,412
I wonder what it will take for you
to understand that you are not,

162
00:18:40,579 --> 00:18:43,165
and never will be a queen.

163
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:45,251
I never wanted to be queen.

164
00:18:45,876 --> 00:18:48,505
I don't think either
of us really believes that.

165
00:18:58,013 --> 00:19:00,474
You needed to have everything
that was mine.

166
00:19:00,558 --> 00:19:01,559
Oh, this isn't about us.

167
00:19:02,143 --> 00:19:03,644
– It's not?
– Sibeth.

168
00:19:04,354 --> 00:19:05,855
We can fix this.

169
00:19:06,355 --> 00:19:10,859
There is still a chance
for everyone to get what they want.

170
00:19:13,404 --> 00:19:15,073
I already have what I want.

171
00:19:16,825 --> 00:19:18,117
You won't kill me.

172
00:19:20,244 --> 00:19:23,789
You might hate me,
but I know you still love me.

173
00:19:36,094 --> 00:19:39,556
You're still the sister
I have loved my whole life.

174
00:19:42,099 --> 00:19:43,934
Who braided my hair.

175
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:47,063
Who made puppets for me.

176
00:19:48,606 --> 00:19:51,567
Who brought me into her bed
when it thundered.

177
00:19:57,907 --> 00:19:59,491
My sister.

178
00:20:02,162 --> 00:20:05,289
Who sung me to sleep
the night Mother died.

179
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:09,211
Never losing patience.

180
00:20:10,295 --> 00:20:12,923
Never once letting go of my hand.

181
00:21:33,961 --> 00:21:35,462
I know. I know.

182
00:23:23,238 --> 00:23:24,864
Is it done, my queen?

183
00:23:33,873 --> 00:23:35,040
Kill her.

184
00:23:44,174 --> 00:23:45,218
– Maghra!
– Tamacti.

185
00:23:45,301 --> 00:23:46,595
Formation!

186
00:24:01,151 --> 00:24:02,693
Ready! And!

187
00:24:02,777 --> 00:24:05,488
– Well, you wanted a fight.
– That I did.

188
00:24:06,155 --> 00:24:07,615
– Kofun!
– Here.

189
00:24:13,329 --> 00:24:14,748
Move!

190
00:24:21,587 --> 00:24:23,339
Resume the attack!

191
00:25:33,492 --> 00:25:37,163
Fire those bombs!
Flatten the fucking city!

192
00:25:37,747 --> 00:25:39,290
Tormada.

193
00:25:39,374 --> 00:25:41,750
– Tormada!
– Baba Voss!

194
00:25:44,753 --> 00:25:46,172
I was hoping I'd run into you.

195
00:25:55,307 --> 00:25:56,892
Dad!

196
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:06,317
Stop them!

197
00:26:26,755 --> 00:26:30,008
Baba Voss! Are you still with us?

198
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:34,762
– I won't make the same mistake twice.
– Tormada!

199
00:28:23,121 --> 00:28:24,873
How are you hurt?

200
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:28,209
I am fine.

201
00:28:29,251 --> 00:28:30,878
Do not follow me.

202
00:28:30,961 --> 00:28:33,882
– Where are you going?
– To end this.

203
00:28:33,964 --> 00:28:36,843
Papa, you cannot go.
You are too badly hurt.

204
00:28:36,926 --> 00:28:38,220
Do not follow me.

205
00:28:38,929 --> 00:28:40,262
I will stay with you.

206
00:28:40,346 --> 00:28:42,598
No. I need you to stay here.

207
00:28:43,307 --> 00:28:46,353
I need you to protect me
with your arrows like you always have.

208
00:28:57,655 --> 00:29:02,285
Look at me. I love you.

209
00:32:40,336 --> 00:32:41,503
Maghra.

210
00:32:45,717 --> 00:32:46,718
Baba.

211
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:51,431
I see you.

212
00:33:01,523 --> 00:33:02,776
Dad!

213
00:34:17,434 --> 00:34:23,523
I walk now, every morning,
past the shops and the homes.

214
00:34:26,693 --> 00:34:28,777
I can hear the families inside…

215
00:34:29,905 --> 00:34:32,574
Talking. Sleeping.

216
00:34:33,157 --> 00:34:36,036
Laughing. Crying.

217
00:34:41,291 --> 00:34:42,458
When I listen to them,

218
00:34:42,541 --> 00:34:48,172
I feel like a mother who wakes up at night
to make sure her baby is still breathing.

219
00:34:51,717 --> 00:34:54,221
I know I'm not really outside
to hear them.

220
00:34:56,972 --> 00:34:59,559
It's you I am seeking.

221
00:35:00,601 --> 00:35:06,315
Some last echo of you still bouncing
between the mountains.

222
00:35:09,485 --> 00:35:12,447
You have left behind a vast emptiness

223
00:35:13,739 --> 00:35:17,077
that wakes me up every morning
and forces me outside.

224
00:35:20,413 --> 00:35:22,248
You never wanted any of this.

225
00:35:23,791 --> 00:35:25,001
I know that.

226
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:31,298
And every day,
I think about what was taken from you.

227
00:35:31,382 --> 00:35:32,884
What I took from you…

228
00:35:34,302 --> 00:35:38,139
in the service of this crown
I'm not even sure I deserve.

229
00:35:43,186 --> 00:35:46,898
Your children feel your absence
every bit as much as I do.

230
00:35:50,943 --> 00:35:54,905
But their futures,
the ones you gave your life to ensure,

231
00:35:54,989 --> 00:35:58,159
stretch out before them
with infinite promise.

232
00:36:01,161 --> 00:36:03,539
Your daughter has followed
in her mother's footsteps

233
00:36:03,623 --> 00:36:05,583
and married a Trivantian.

234
00:36:06,501 --> 00:36:10,213
Two sighted women making their way
in this world.

235
00:36:12,757 --> 00:36:15,677
It won't be easy, and I fear for them.

236
00:36:17,721 --> 00:36:20,764
But I hear the love in their voices
when they speak.

237
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:31,775
Kofun is coming into his own as a father.

238
00:36:34,487 --> 00:36:38,115
And I know having a son means
not a day will go by

239
00:36:38,199 --> 00:36:40,284
that he doesn't think of his own father.

240
00:36:46,916 --> 00:36:50,753
I find myself drawn
to this terrible place…

241
00:36:52,963 --> 00:36:58,385
whose charred soil holds the remains
of both my sister and my husband.

242
00:37:00,222 --> 00:37:04,976
And I wonder how anything
will ever grow again in this burned,

243
00:37:05,059 --> 00:37:06,061
ruined earth.

244
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:16,487
I don't know where we go when we die.

245
00:37:18,155 --> 00:37:19,657
But wherever you are,

246
00:37:20,659 --> 00:37:22,244
I hope you have finally found

247
00:37:22,327 --> 00:37:26,498
the peace you tried so hard
to find in life.

248
00:37:28,416 --> 00:37:31,503
For you and for all of us.

249
00:37:32,795 --> 00:37:34,880
And I hope you can forgive me.

250
00:38:01,782 --> 00:38:03,909
No one is denying
the debt we owe Paya

251
00:38:03,994 --> 00:38:06,996
for defeating Tormada
and destroying his weapons.

252
00:38:07,621 --> 00:38:11,251
I myself barely escaped his attack
on our own government.

253
00:38:12,251 --> 00:38:15,630
However, we cannot sign this,
or any treaty,

254
00:38:15,713 --> 00:38:19,092
with a nation that will allow sanctuary
to the sighted.

255
00:38:19,717 --> 00:38:23,387
We've all just borne witness
to the destructive power of vision.

256
00:38:24,222 --> 00:38:26,557
It is the position
of the Trivantian people

257
00:38:27,141 --> 00:38:31,688
that vision simply poses too much
of a risk to all of us.

258
00:38:31,771 --> 00:38:33,981
I understand your position.

259
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:37,902
But it was not vision
that built Tormada's bombs,

260
00:38:37,985 --> 00:38:41,447
but Tormada's cruel exploitation
of sighted children

261
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:43,699
that accessed the knowledge
of the ancients.

262
00:38:44,284 --> 00:38:48,163
And it is that destructive knowledge,
not vision itself,

263
00:38:48,704 --> 00:38:50,414
that needs to be outlawed.

264
00:38:51,291 --> 00:38:56,253
The sighted will always be the gateway
to this knowledge.

265
00:38:56,338 --> 00:38:58,965
And there will always
be people like Tormada

266
00:38:59,048 --> 00:39:01,009
who would choose to exploit them.

267
00:39:01,675 --> 00:39:04,596
We stand with three sighted people,

268
00:39:05,222 --> 00:39:08,807
all of whom have played a significant role
in defeating Tormada

269
00:39:08,891 --> 00:39:11,186
– and destroying his bombs.
– Yes.

270
00:39:11,268 --> 00:39:14,313
And as we said earlier,
we will grant them amnesty.

271
00:39:14,396 --> 00:39:16,106
Why should we need amnesty?

272
00:39:16,942 --> 00:39:18,443
We haven't done anything wrong.

273
00:39:19,152 --> 00:39:21,070
Uh, in fact, i-if it weren't for us,

274
00:39:21,153 --> 00:39:23,757
then Tormada and his bombs
would be destroying your city right now.

275
00:39:23,782 --> 00:39:26,117
Haniwa, now is not the time.

276
00:39:26,201 --> 00:39:28,661
– No? When is the right time?
– Princess!

277
00:39:28,744 --> 00:39:31,039
I fear you have forgotten
who you're talking to.

278
00:39:31,121 --> 00:39:32,666
I think it is you who has forgotten.

279
00:39:32,748 --> 00:39:34,333
Ambassador, I apologize...

280
00:39:34,833 --> 00:39:39,047
Vision is not coming back!
It's already here.

281
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:40,882
And if I were you,

282
00:39:40,965 --> 00:39:43,050
I'd be grateful
that we are offering you peace,

283
00:39:43,134 --> 00:39:45,844
because trust me,
you do not want us as an enemy.

284
00:39:48,347 --> 00:39:51,226
– Was that a threat?
– Of course not...

285
00:39:51,309 --> 00:39:54,103
Ambassador, I apologize.
You must understand,

286
00:39:54,186 --> 00:39:57,565
my sister and I have been hunted
our entire lives

287
00:39:58,525 --> 00:40:00,527
simply because of how we were born.

288
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:05,155
The idea that I
or anyone like me would be a threat

289
00:40:05,239 --> 00:40:08,409
to the unsighted is based simply
on superstition and fear,

290
00:40:08,492 --> 00:40:10,494
and not the reality of who I am.

291
00:40:11,036 --> 00:40:15,458
Because who I am has nothing to do
with the fact that I can see.

292
00:40:18,335 --> 00:40:19,588
I'm a son.

293
00:40:20,505 --> 00:40:21,755
I'm a father.

294
00:40:22,548 --> 00:40:23,842
I'm a Payan.

295
00:40:26,219 --> 00:40:29,514
But most importantly,
I'm your partner in peace.

296
00:40:31,766 --> 00:40:35,644
So, please. May we continue?

297
00:40:44,195 --> 00:40:45,195
Very well.

298
00:40:52,704 --> 00:40:53,704
Haniwa.

299
00:40:53,788 --> 00:40:55,206
Tak.

300
00:40:55,289 --> 00:40:56,625
Tak.

301
00:40:56,708 --> 00:40:58,376
Did she accept?

302
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:02,672
They agreed to talk more about it
down the road.

303
00:41:03,215 --> 00:41:04,507
But for now?

304
00:41:06,009 --> 00:41:07,344
She has no choice.

305
00:41:08,094 --> 00:41:10,931
She has to think of the kingdom.
We cannot afford another war.

306
00:41:11,014 --> 00:41:12,681
She promised to protect us.

307
00:41:12,766 --> 00:41:14,726
She has an entire kingdom to protect.

308
00:41:14,809 --> 00:41:16,894
And as prince and princess, so do we.

309
00:41:19,231 --> 00:41:21,791
You don't really think that you're going
to be king here, do you?

310
00:41:24,652 --> 00:41:27,239
The people of Paya
would never allow a sighted king.

311
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:30,407
And even if they did,
the Trivantians wouldn't allow it.

312
00:41:31,117 --> 00:41:33,077
You heard what they said there.

313
00:41:34,329 --> 00:41:37,666
Forget being king or queen, Kofun.
They don't even want us to exist!

314
00:41:37,748 --> 00:41:39,918
– Why are you so angry?
– Why are you not?

315
00:41:41,001 --> 00:41:42,836
We will never belong here.

316
00:41:43,838 --> 00:41:45,422
This isn't our world.

317
00:41:46,715 --> 00:41:48,217
This is where my family is.

318
00:41:50,804 --> 00:41:52,429
This is where I'll raise my son.

319
00:41:56,268 --> 00:41:58,644
Your son will always live
in a different world than you.

320
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:24,503
My children will never forgive me.

321
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:28,717
You saved thousands of lives,
including theirs.

322
00:42:29,925 --> 00:42:33,804
You formed the beginnings
of a true dialogue with Trivantes.

323
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:37,726
But vision is once again forbidden.

324
00:42:39,643 --> 00:42:43,523
When I was young,
my father used to fish for salmon.

325
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:46,818
Every autumn,
he'd bring me down to the river,

326
00:42:46,902 --> 00:42:48,110
and we'd fish.

327
00:42:49,237 --> 00:42:52,157
For the first few days,
we'd usually catch nothing.

328
00:42:53,574 --> 00:42:56,494
Then one day, we'd catch one.

329
00:42:57,871 --> 00:42:58,996
Two.

330
00:42:59,496 --> 00:43:01,541
Hardly enough for a household.

331
00:43:02,208 --> 00:43:05,045
But enough to know
that the next day there'd be more.

332
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:08,757
Five salmon, ten salmon.

333
00:43:09,548 --> 00:43:13,052
Soon the entire river
would be teeming with salmon.

334
00:43:15,512 --> 00:43:17,556
Vision is coming back.

335
00:43:18,807 --> 00:43:22,019
You and I have met
the first few fish swimming upstream.

336
00:43:23,313 --> 00:43:24,606
More will come.

337
00:43:25,398 --> 00:43:27,400
Some are, no doubt, already here.

338
00:43:28,275 --> 00:43:29,652
Others will follow.

339
00:43:31,528 --> 00:43:35,574
No law, no religion will stop it.

340
00:43:38,827 --> 00:43:43,291
How we choose to handle it
within our borders is our business.

341
00:43:43,875 --> 00:43:46,670
The Trivantians
made their position very clear.

342
00:43:46,753 --> 00:43:50,340
Politicians following a script
they know nothing about.

343
00:43:51,132 --> 00:43:53,760
The war over vision will be fought,

344
00:43:53,842 --> 00:43:58,514
not between Paya and Trivantes,
but within cities.

345
00:44:00,099 --> 00:44:01,393
Within families.

346
00:44:03,103 --> 00:44:04,478
Within our own hearts.

347
00:44:06,231 --> 00:44:08,733
Regardless, nature will have its way.

348
00:44:09,943 --> 00:44:11,235
She always does.

349
00:44:14,864 --> 00:44:16,074
Well…

350
00:44:17,492 --> 00:44:19,827
you seem to have made
your own peace with it.

351
00:44:20,869 --> 00:44:23,789
The single advantage
to being as horribly wrong

352
00:44:23,873 --> 00:44:29,253
as I've been in my life
is that new ideas are easier to accept.

353
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:36,219
Smells like death.

354
00:44:47,021 --> 00:44:49,523
I think Baba always knew
he would die in battle.

355
00:44:50,942 --> 00:44:51,943
He told me once,

356
00:44:52,443 --> 00:44:56,239
death must be earned
every bit as much as life.

357
00:44:57,782 --> 00:45:01,119
With his last breath,
he defeated an entire army.

358
00:45:01,619 --> 00:45:04,496
And by doing so, saved us all.

359
00:45:05,789 --> 00:45:07,583
I think his death was well earned.

360
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:10,878
You sound a bit envious.

361
00:45:14,965 --> 00:45:18,302
But while I'm still walking here
on this earth,

362
00:45:18,802 --> 00:45:21,514
I'll do my best
to keep you out of trouble.

363
00:45:30,565 --> 00:45:32,817
I would be lost without you, Tamacti.

364
00:45:33,693 --> 00:45:35,778
How so very sad for both of us.

365
00:45:45,746 --> 00:45:48,166
I miss him, Ranger.

366
00:45:50,710 --> 00:45:52,836
Baba was a giant man,

367
00:45:53,547 --> 00:45:56,423
so it makes sense
that there's a giant-sized hole

368
00:45:56,507 --> 00:45:58,300
in the space he used to fill.

369
00:46:02,639 --> 00:46:04,641
You know, Baba died for you.

370
00:46:05,559 --> 00:46:06,809
For all of us.

371
00:46:09,396 --> 00:46:12,315
But it's important
to remember not that he died for you,

372
00:46:13,315 --> 00:46:14,943
but that he lived for you.

373
00:46:16,527 --> 00:46:18,362
If he was here, that's what he would say.

374
00:46:25,161 --> 00:46:26,829
I hear Lu has arrived.

375
00:46:26,913 --> 00:46:28,248
Yes.

376
00:46:30,583 --> 00:46:32,335
Yes, we head home tomorrow.

377
00:46:33,003 --> 00:46:34,420
You're welcome to stay.

378
00:46:36,755 --> 00:46:41,219
Thanks, um, but, uh, Lu and I,

379
00:46:41,302 --> 00:46:46,599
we don't like crowds or people,
you know, crowds of people.

380
00:46:48,601 --> 00:46:50,394
Well, I could give you a horse.

381
00:47:08,663 --> 00:47:09,873
Haniwa!

382
00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:13,001
Charlotte?

383
00:47:16,503 --> 00:47:17,672
Haniwa!

384
00:47:27,181 --> 00:47:29,643
Nah, I'm not back. Not for long anyway.

385
00:47:30,643 --> 00:47:32,311
I just needed to make sure you were okay.

386
00:47:34,563 --> 00:47:36,273
I'm so sorry to hear about Baba.

387
00:47:37,525 --> 00:47:39,204
Then I heard that you
and Wren got married,

388
00:47:39,277 --> 00:47:40,862
and I'm so happy about that.

389
00:47:40,945 --> 00:47:43,739
And now I don't know if I should talk
about the sad thing first

390
00:47:43,822 --> 00:47:46,617
and then the happy thing?
Or do it the other way,

391
00:47:46,701 --> 00:47:48,501
or maybe you don't wanna talk
about it at all.

392
00:47:50,329 --> 00:47:54,918
How did it go with the Compass?
How are Sheva and the kids?

393
00:47:55,001 --> 00:47:56,269
Well, the little ones are great.

394
00:47:56,293 --> 00:47:58,170
I don't think Sheva
likes me very much.

395
00:47:58,255 --> 00:48:00,715
But I don't like her either,
so, you know, that'll work out.

396
00:48:07,472 --> 00:48:09,014
She said you'd know what it means.

397
00:48:36,166 --> 00:48:38,168
She wishes you a safe journey.

398
00:48:39,170 --> 00:48:43,800
So… I take it you're going somewhere?

399
00:48:46,594 --> 00:48:48,096
Will you come with us?

400
00:48:50,681 --> 00:48:52,141
Not this time.

401
00:48:58,023 --> 00:48:59,608
Who will keep me safe?

402
00:49:04,653 --> 00:49:06,072
And she has you.

403
00:49:06,864 --> 00:49:09,159
I am needed at the Compass.

404
00:49:10,117 --> 00:49:12,746
Jerlamarel's children
will be keeping us busy and…

405
00:49:13,496 --> 00:49:15,414
I get the feeling more will be coming.

406
00:49:16,750 --> 00:49:17,809
They are lucky to have you.

407
00:49:28,637 --> 00:49:30,387
You be careful out there.

408
00:49:31,847 --> 00:49:33,141
You too.

409
00:49:43,275 --> 00:49:44,777
Thank you.

410
00:49:47,072 --> 00:49:48,657
It was my pleasure.

411
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:51,076
I'm not crying.

412
00:49:53,827 --> 00:49:55,413
Will you come find me?

413
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:03,755
You come find me.

414
00:50:22,065 --> 00:50:23,775
Are you sure
you don't want to say goodbye?

415
00:50:26,235 --> 00:50:27,820
It wouldn't go well.

416
00:50:34,034 --> 00:50:35,327
I'll see them again.

417
00:51:05,190 --> 00:51:06,860
It's getting chilly.

418
00:51:08,152 --> 00:51:09,653
Winter will be here soon.

419
00:51:13,867 --> 00:51:16,577
It's been almost a year
and still no word from Haniwa.

420
00:51:17,913 --> 00:51:20,039
It could be a while till we hear from her.

421
00:51:21,166 --> 00:51:23,083
Do you ever think about the Alkenny?

422
00:51:24,251 --> 00:51:25,461
Every day.

423
00:51:26,213 --> 00:51:28,340
Just the four of us, always together.

424
00:51:29,465 --> 00:51:34,387
I'm sure we were sometimes cold,
but in my memories it's always warm.

425
00:51:37,766 --> 00:51:41,436
I thought when I became queen,

426
00:51:42,394 --> 00:51:44,356
I would be able to give us that.

427
00:51:45,523 --> 00:51:47,858
But once we set out
to find the Lavender road,

428
00:51:48,777 --> 00:51:51,195
we were never going
to be that family again.

429
00:51:52,072 --> 00:51:53,364
No.

430
00:51:54,032 --> 00:51:57,244
But we are still a family.

431
00:52:02,791 --> 00:52:04,833
You handle yourself well with the council.

432
00:52:05,835 --> 00:52:07,420
You've earned their trust.

433
00:52:09,588 --> 00:52:13,552
Maybe… you were born to do this.

434
00:52:13,635 --> 00:52:16,887
Well, Haniwa says the kingdom
would never accept a sighted king.

435
00:52:18,472 --> 00:52:19,891
What do you say?

436
00:52:23,061 --> 00:52:26,690
I know what Dad would say. He would say,

437
00:52:36,949 --> 00:52:38,952
I think my eyes have betrayed me.

438
00:52:41,496 --> 00:52:42,914
And they will again.

439
00:52:46,126 --> 00:52:47,543
What are you saying?

440
00:52:53,257 --> 00:52:55,677
My father died trying
to save this kingdom.

441
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:58,304
If they weren't my people before,
they are now.

442
00:52:59,764 --> 00:53:02,809
I can't fully serve the people or my son

443
00:53:02,893 --> 00:53:05,019
if my sense
of the world is different from theirs.

444
00:53:09,983 --> 00:53:15,322
I'm saying, I think I've seen enough.

445
00:53:22,704 --> 00:53:25,956
I want to live in the same world
as my son.

446
00:53:29,668 --> 00:53:35,090
I want to hear, feel, smell what he does.

447
00:53:48,355 --> 00:53:49,356
Kofun.

448
00:53:51,523 --> 00:53:53,193
There's no going back.

449
00:53:55,695 --> 00:53:58,155
You'd have to be absolutely sure.

450
00:54:03,494 --> 00:54:04,871
I'm sure.

451
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:23,802
You made it.

452
00:56:29,766 --> 00:56:30,766
You know us?

453
00:56:31,601 --> 00:56:34,478
No. Not yet anyway.

454
00:56:36,565 --> 00:56:39,650
But I am so glad you found us.

455
00:56:40,443 --> 00:56:42,695
As I'm sure you can imagine,

456
00:56:43,612 --> 00:56:47,157
everyone here has been
on a journey very similar to your own.

457
00:56:50,911 --> 00:56:54,081
I am Michaela. And you are?

458
00:56:56,458 --> 00:56:57,626
Haniwa.

459
00:57:02,965 --> 00:57:03,967
Wren.

460
00:57:05,467 --> 00:57:08,762
Welcome, Haniwa and Wren.

461
00:57:11,099 --> 00:57:15,686
Well, don't just stand there.
Come down and meet everyone.

462
00:57:50,512 --> 00:57:51,514
Welcome.

463
00:57:53,349 --> 00:57:54,643
Hi.
