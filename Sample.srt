1
00:00:54,096 --> 00:00:56,974
I only came here out of respect
for my parents who...

2
00:00:57,849 --> 00:01:00,018
Knew your family.

3
00:01:00,102 --> 00:01:04,147
Your father was more than just a friend
to my family.

4
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:09,194
That was a long time ago.

5
00:01:10,946 --> 00:01:11,946
Yes.

6
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:15,659
A long time.

7
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:18,203
Thomas Wayne believed in my father.

8
00:01:18,287 --> 00:01:21,707
He believed a man could bring order
to a world of chaos.

9
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:25,252
And you, Bruce?

10
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:34,052
I believe in Gotham city.

11
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:46,231
- You try the vongole?
- Mm. Delicious.

12
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,420
Oh. Hmm.

13
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:55,021
Master Bruce. Happy Halloween.

14
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:58,316
- Is there coffee?
- In the study, sir.

15
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,030
A miss Kyle telephoned.

16
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:07,909
She said she was checking the number
you gave her to make sure it's real.

17
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:12,372
The gates are open. We haven't
seen a trick-or-treater in years.

18
00:06:13,248 --> 00:06:14,332
We won't see one tonight.

19
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,835
Hardly worth the security risk,
wouldn't you say?

20
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,044
Respectfully, sir,

21
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:22,507
if our security is dependent
on $600 worth of iron alloy...

22
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,887
This city is fallen, Alfred.

23
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:34,477
Then we must endeavor
to lift it up again, Bruce.

24
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:41,401
In the meantime,
we live in obstinate hope.

25
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:43,612
And an unlocked mansion.

26
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:45,821
Anyway...

27
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:48,408
It's an absurd holiday.

28
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:52,203
Oh, yes.
Putting on costumes and striking fear.

29
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:54,122
Quite absurd.

30
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:57,626
Do you really think...

31
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:02,213
I hate when he does that.

32
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:11,806
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.

33
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,725
James, babs! No running!

34
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:20,065
Come on, guys, slow down.
You're gonna hurt yourselves.

35
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:23,360
They're excited, Jim. Big night.

36
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:27,155
Yeah. All right.
But we're taking the squad car.

37
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:29,824
Too many crazies out.

38
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:31,408
Sir!

39
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,289
Hang on.

40
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,341
Now, you're ready.

41
00:07:47,676 --> 00:07:49,761
All right, who wants to drive?

42
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:52,972
Jim!

43
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:58,628
Just joking.

44
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:05,360
Hey, hey, hang on.

45
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:09,155
It could be a wrong number,
or a crank call or...

46
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:12,825
Gordon.

47
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,078
Uh-huh...

48
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:16,996
When?

49
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,582
All right. I'm on my way.

50
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,295
Your father's captain now.

51
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:26,673
The whole department's counting on him.

52
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:30,176
Well, I was counting on him, too.

53
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:40,020
I'll try and be quick.

54
00:08:58,163 --> 00:08:59,163
Hello?

55
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,803
Gilda, there you are.

56
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:16,472
What?

57
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,224
Harvey.

58
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:21,895
- You're home.
- Better late than never.

59
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,731
Why are you hiding out here in the cold?

60
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:27,567
I know. I'm sorry, I just...

61
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,073
Mm, you started without me.

62
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,576
Did you have any kids?

63
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:39,661
What?

64
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:42,206
Trick-or-treaters.

65
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:47,587
Oh, no. I don't... no. I just...

66
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:51,424
I don't think I'm really up
for all that tonight.

67
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:53,384
Answering the door every five minutes...

68
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:55,302
Smiling.

69
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,889
Yeah, I saw the bowl on the porch.

70
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:00,141
It's okay. It's a ghost town out there.

71
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:01,601
So to speak.

72
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:03,444
We're gonna be eating
that candy for a month.

73
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:09,400
Or not.

74
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:12,237
You know I have a love-hate
relationship with candy.

75
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,365
You have a love-hate
relationship with everything.

76
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:24,124
Let's just crawl into bed

77
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:26,126
and watch an old
black and white movie on...

78
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:27,377
Baby, I'm so sorry.

79
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:34,300
You have to go.

80
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:36,636
Pick a movie. I'll be back soon.

81
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:39,012
I love you.

82
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:06,124
Does he always keep you
waiting like this?

83
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:07,750
He'll be here.

84
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:10,795
I thought you quit.

85
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:13,089
I have.

86
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:16,301
Hmm. Don't worry, I won't tell Barbara.

87
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:18,011
Gentlemen.

88
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:23,808
Ah. Good.

89
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:25,393
This is district attorney Harvey d...

90
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:26,769
Bats.

91
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:28,562
Dent.

92
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,482
Okay.

93
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:34,652
What's happened?

94
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:37,113
Johnny viti was murdered tonight.

95
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:39,448
Damn it!

96
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:41,111
The Roman's nephew.

97
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:42,285
He has a name.

98
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,245
It's carmine Falcone, not "the Roman."

99
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:45,163
Harvey, calm down.

100
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:48,249
Where were your men, Jim?
I've been working on viti for months!

101
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,460
Nobody on your team thought
he'd be vulnerable

102
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:53,004
the night before he's gonna
turn state's evidence?

103
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,593
.22 caliber, taped handle,

104
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:00,678
serial number filed off.

105
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:04,098
Baby bottle nipple
for a silencer. Odd, but effective.

106
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:05,683
And untraceable.

107
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,661
Hard to tell if we're dealing
with a professional.

108
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:09,270
Of course it was a professional!

109
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,563
This was Falcone!

110
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:13,149
He found out viti
was gonna betray the family,

111
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:15,360
so he took him off the board!

112
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:16,861
Maybe.

113
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,032
We were so close.

114
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:24,535
We were so close, Jim.

115
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:26,412
He was ready to sing.

116
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:29,374
And not just about carmine,
the whole family was going away.

117
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:32,001
We had a real opportunity
to change things.

118
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:35,129
We still do. It's just a setback.

119
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:37,340
We'll find another way
to take down Falcone.

120
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:38,423
Together.

121
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:41,094
Where's the Jack-o'-lantern?

122
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,303
Excuse me?

123
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:47,767
You think it's important?

124
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:49,602
I don't know yet.

125
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:51,521
Look, Harvey's right.

126
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,649
This city's finally got a chance.

127
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:57,986
And it's the three men
standing here right now.

128
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:01,197
The Falcone crime family
has to be taken down.

129
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:03,491
So, I'm putting you two together.

130
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:06,411
District attorney dent
will work in the light, and you...

131
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:09,747
Will work the other side.

132
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:12,709
Bend the rules, but never break them.

133
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,253
And I'll do everything
I can to protect you both.

134
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,839
Understood.

135
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,305
He needs
to hear you say it, bats.

136
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:28,808
Two heads are better than one.

137
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:39,027
Leads come my way pretty fast.

138
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:41,362
Keep your ears open.

139
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:43,072
Then I guess we're up and...

140
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:45,574
Running.

141
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,870
He does that a lot. I just...

142
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:53,249
And I'm talking to myself.

143
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:32,245
Godfather.

144
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:35,500
I'm so sorry to hear about your nephew.

145
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:37,251
Grazie, amico.

146
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:39,503
Carmine,

147
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:40,963
no disrespect

148
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:43,508
but why are we sitting
on our hands here, huh?

149
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,426
He put two in Johnny's head!

150
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,010
Who did?

151
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:49,389
Salvatore maroni! Who else?

152
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:52,517
Ever since he took over that family,
he's been gunning for us,

153
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,727
and tonight he found the target.

154
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:56,854
It's a warning, for Christ sakes!

155
00:14:58,106 --> 00:14:59,106
Perhaps.

156
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,818
But let us be clear.

157
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:05,905
The man who pulled the trigger
did not load the gun.

158
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:10,493
Maroni's ambition was in check
until the law put a target on my back.

159
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:13,996
Now, it's open season.

160
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,166
If anyone is responsible
for my nephew's death,

161
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:20,586
it's that new son of a bitch
in the da's office.

162
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:22,379
Dent.

163
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:28,136
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.
- Maybe he should sleep with the fishes.

164
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:29,804
Hell yes!

165
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:32,807
You just say the word, carmine,
and I'll do dent myself!

166
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:35,977
Settle, antoni.

167
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,397
At the right time, we'll hit back.
Until then...

168
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,566
The right time is now, carmine!

169
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:45,069
Now! Any delay is only gonna
make you look even weaker!

170
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:53,786
Thank you for your concern, antoni.

171
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:59,417
No disrespect, carmine.

172
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:06,048
It's "godfather."

173
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:08,259
Milos. Come on!

174
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:11,136
Please!

175
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,223
Milos! No!

176
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:36,078
We have other business to discuss?

177
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:39,664
Alberto?

178
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:42,375
Alberto!

179
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:46,339
Business time.

180
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:48,007
Take your crosswords for a walk.

181
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:52,220
They're... logic puzzles.

182
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:56,933
Thirty-two going on 13.

183
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:05,733
Wayne is not gonna support
any large-scale structuring effort.

184
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:10,655
So, for now, the assets will have to be
moved to a more secure facility.

185
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:02,999
Your equipment's weighing you down.

186
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:04,834
Why are you running?

187
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:08,629
Fun. You could use a little fun.

188
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:48,668
Give me your hand.

189
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:51,796
Nah.

190
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:40,680
Got you exactly where I want you.

191
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:46,102
Falcone.

192
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:48,562
Wait till you see what's inside.

193
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,950
Mm...

194
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,285
Have you ever seen this kind of money?

195
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:05,912
It's authentic.

196
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:11,627
So crisp and clean.

197
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:13,754
Actually, it's incredibly dirty.

198
00:20:13,838 --> 00:20:16,549
Falcone's been having trouble
laundering his cash for some time.

199
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:19,385
We just didn't know
where he was stockpiling it.

200
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:23,973
Thank you.

201
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:26,016
I'm happy to help.

202
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:33,315
You could have kept it to yourself.

203
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:35,276
You could have lived
pretty well with all this.

204
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:36,776
Why hand it over?

205
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:38,653
To you?

206
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:47,787
Who knows?

207
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,260
Get down!

208
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:07,099
Take it from me, pal,

209
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:10,060
around here,
curiosity can get you killed.

210
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:11,061
Let him go.

211
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:12,605
What? Why?

212
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:13,689
Because he's with me.

213
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:19,528
Also, because he's the da
who put all your friends into arkham.

214
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,364
We got room for one more.

215
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:30,039
Anyone follow us?

216
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:31,707
I could barely follow us.

217
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:42,843
Falcone imports has been doing
quite a business.

218
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:53,354
You know, if we were any other men...

219
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:54,437
We're not.

220
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:57,817
Yeah. No. Of course.

221
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:01,654
So, what now?

222
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:03,322
We should call Gordon.

223
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:06,075
Have his men pick this up as evidence.

224
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:09,829
Falcone owns the mayor
and the entire city assembly.

225
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:11,705
It'd be back in his coffers by tomorrow.

226
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:16,460
So, the only way to make
an impact is to make it disappear.

227
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:19,588
Yeah, but look at all this.
Moving it could take days.

228
00:22:23,217 --> 00:22:25,261
Well, who said anything about moving it?

229
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:31,183
Why are you trying to hurt Falcone?

230
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:34,061
Why are you?

231
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:37,106
It's not personal, sweetheart.
Itsjusfice.

232
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:40,776
Justice can be personal, sweetie.

233
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:44,196
Give me a head start.

234
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,198
I don't want to get caught
anywhere near here.

235
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:48,325
I don't know.

236
00:22:48,409 --> 00:22:50,209
Gordon says
I'm supposed to work in the light.

237
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:51,871
Well, then, light it up.

238
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,585
I owe you one.

239
00:22:59,837 --> 00:23:01,088
You owe me, like...

240
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:03,591
A billion-five.

241
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:16,353
I can't really be a lawyer
and a criminal, can I?

242
00:23:17,605 --> 00:23:19,106
I want to win.

243
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,984
But do I want to win like this?

244
00:23:23,277 --> 00:23:25,362
I'm of two minds here.

245
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:28,198
So, it's a coin flip.

246
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,412
Yeah, I guess it is.

247
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:35,164
Heads, we burn it down.

248
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:38,250
Okay.

249
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:56,851
Call chen.

250
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:03,543
Firefighters on the scene
here in the industrial district

251
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:04,944
working to contain the Blaze

252
00:24:05,027 --> 00:24:07,696
before it can spread
to nearby homes and businesses.

253
00:24:08,072 --> 00:24:09,448
Now, at this time, Jackie,

254
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:12,785
officials believe
the Falcone imports warehouse...

255
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:15,454
Owned, of course,
by the notorious Falcone crime family,

256
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:16,537
to be vacant...

257
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:36,350
"Two heads are better than one."

258
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:48,653
Gilda?

259
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:53,283
Gilda?

260
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:08,507
Hey! You scared me.

261
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:11,343
I came home
and I didn't know where you were.

262
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,636
Did you hear me calling?

263
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:15,597
Please stay.

264
00:25:16,724 --> 00:25:17,891
I'm not going anywhere.

265
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:20,644
I mean it. Don't leave me.

266
00:25:21,437 --> 00:25:24,440
Baby, I know I haven't been around.
And I'm sorry.

267
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:25,649
But this job...

268
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:27,568
It isn't forever.

269
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:36,618
Hey, we caught a huge break tonight
on this Falcone thing.

270
00:25:37,453 --> 00:25:40,414
Once I take him out,
and I will take him out,

271
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:42,958
things are gonna be different.

272
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:45,210
We can start a family.

273
00:25:48,422 --> 00:25:49,506
You know I can't.

274
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:53,302
Of course you can. We can.

275
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:55,220
We'll talk about options
when you're ready,

276
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,765
but I need you to trust
that we're still on track.

277
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:00,392
And that I love you.

278
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:05,397
Now, are we still having
movie night, or not?

279
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:08,942
No, don't even answer that. Come on.

280
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:57,699
If we take 66th, we can cut them off
at the westward bridge.

281
00:26:57,783 --> 00:27:00,369
No. Maintain a safe distance for now.

282
00:27:24,685 --> 00:27:26,770
Good evening, sir.
The Turkey is roasting,

283
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:30,482
the pies are cooling,
and miss Kyle is en route.

284
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:38,699
Alfred, make a note
to order a new windshield.

285
00:27:38,949 --> 00:27:39,949
Bulletproof.

286
00:27:40,117 --> 00:27:42,077
Of course, sir, but if! May...

287
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:35,087
Aah!

288
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:48,310
I thought
you didn't hurt people!

289
00:28:53,482 --> 00:28:54,650
You thought wrong.

290
00:28:57,444 --> 00:28:59,071
You and your San ho hui buddies

291
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:01,740
were seen outside Harvey dent's house
on Halloween.

292
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:03,617
We were trick-or-treating.

293
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,120
Having fun?

294
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:10,415
Not yet.

295
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:12,417
But any second now.

296
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:45,783
Yeah!

297
00:31:54,496 --> 00:31:57,749
Go. I'll keep an eye
on your little friends.

298
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,628
A "thank you" would be nice!

299
00:32:04,214 --> 00:32:05,632
It is Thanksgiving.

300
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:17,853
We can make this easy, Mickey.

301
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,856
Just tell me who hired you to kill dent.

302
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,274
Go to hell, bat-freak!

303
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:27,696
Right now, the only difference
between you and me

304
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:29,781
is that I know what's down here.

305
00:32:35,996 --> 00:32:37,164
Hmm.

306
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:50,342
Grundy.

307
00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:53,221
He's mine.

308
00:32:53,889 --> 00:32:54,889
Let him go.

309
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,770
This is your place.

310
00:33:00,854 --> 00:33:03,940
Give him to me and I'll make sure
he never sets foot down here again.

311
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:09,613
You can be alone.

312
00:33:29,174 --> 00:33:32,886
Born on a Monday.

313
00:33:44,773 --> 00:33:46,066
One more for ya.

314
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:47,858
My goodness.

315
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:50,570
People have been so kind to Harvey.

316
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:55,158
Oh, this one's not for your husband.
It's for you.

317
00:33:57,494 --> 00:33:59,871
From a "Mr. Falcone."

318
00:34:04,793 --> 00:34:06,127
I'm sorry, ma'am.

319
00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:08,131
It's none of my business...

320
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:10,090
Isn't it time for his dinner?

321
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:21,059
I don't wanna be here, Mick.

322
00:34:22,644 --> 00:34:24,896
My wife's cooking Turkey
with all the trimmings.

323
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:28,024
I love Turkey with all the trimmings.

324
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:31,486
So, just tell us what you know

325
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:33,488
about the bomb
in the district attorney's house,

326
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:35,073
then we can all go eat.

327
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:38,994
I don't even know carmine Falcone.

328
00:34:40,954 --> 00:34:44,749
The Roman contracted your triad
to take out Harvey dent!

329
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:46,668
Your signature's all over it.

330
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:50,505
Mickey, you gotta help me
keep my friend here calm.

331
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:51,840
Just give us something...

332
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:53,507
Anything.

333
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:57,053
Someone's trying to frame me.

334
00:34:57,137 --> 00:34:59,639
I told you. I'm innocent.

335
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:02,058
Chairs are for suspects.

336
00:35:02,142 --> 00:35:03,518
This guy's innocent.

337
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:08,648
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

338
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:11,985
Hey. I thought we were
just doing a thing.

339
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,779
This little act doesn't get us anywhere
if the guy gets hurt.

340
00:35:14,863 --> 00:35:17,657
Maybe you guys should admit
you have nothing on San ho hui.

341
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:20,744
If you had,
you would've booked me already.

342
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:23,872
All right. That's it. Montoya!

343
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:27,876
Please, show our friend out.

344
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:30,795
Maybe you should thank
whoever planted that bomb.

345
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:32,756
What did you say?

346
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:35,717
You still haven't figured out
who killed Johnny viti?

347
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:39,763
Get him outta my sight.

348
00:35:45,018 --> 00:35:46,478
You may be aces in a fistfight,

349
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:49,189
but you've got a lot to learn
about detective work.

350
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:50,940
I found him, didn't I?

351
00:35:51,024 --> 00:35:52,692
It's not just about finding them.

352
00:35:52,776 --> 00:35:54,986
You gotta know how
they're gonna help your case.

353
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:58,239
Mickey chen is a small fish
protected by Falcone.

354
00:35:59,074 --> 00:36:01,242
We were never going to get a confession.

355
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:04,579
We needed to make friends
and, in time, flip him.

356
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:07,540
Keep talking like that,
they'll make you da.

357
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:09,584
Harvey isn't dead yet.

358
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:12,128
And he isn't a killer, either.

359
00:36:12,212 --> 00:36:14,047
No matter what that scumbag thinks.

360
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:16,966
He's never even owned a gun.

361
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:18,718
Falcone fits.

362
00:36:18,802 --> 00:36:21,721
The Roman killed viti
and ordered the hit on dent.

363
00:36:21,805 --> 00:36:22,805
Occam's razor.

364
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:26,893
The simplest explanation
is usually the right one.

365
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:30,063
All right. If! Leave now,
I might just make dinner.

366
00:36:32,649 --> 00:36:34,150
You should be with your people, too.

367
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:39,905
Fine.

368
00:36:47,831 --> 00:36:48,998
Good night.

369
00:36:49,082 --> 00:36:50,834
Happy Thanksgiving, Mrs. Dent.

370
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:55,797
Now, I'm sure the missus is running out
to pick up some real food,

371
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:59,217
but I guarantee you, you have
never had pumpkin pie like...

372
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:03,888
Uh, Mr. Dent?

373
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:14,315
I just, you know, wanna get out
of the city, I hate this place.

374
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:15,399
Nice.

375
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:25,034
The secret is the basil.

376
00:37:25,118 --> 00:37:28,371
You want only the youngest leaves
from the youngest plant,

377
00:37:28,455 --> 00:37:30,206
othennise, it's like mint.

378
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:33,626
Overpowers everything.

379
00:37:34,294 --> 00:37:36,838
We have a lot
to be thankful for, Alberto.

380
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,131
Such as?

381
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,925
Health. Family.

382
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:43,094
What's left of it.

383
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:47,307
If you are referring
to your cousin Johnny,

384
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:48,683
that is being handled.

385
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:50,727
By Mickey chen.

386
00:37:53,855 --> 00:37:56,065
And who do you think hired him?

387
00:37:57,317 --> 00:37:58,902
Of course.

388
00:38:01,863 --> 00:38:03,740
Is there something you wish to say?

389
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:07,660
No, poppa.

390
00:38:07,744 --> 00:38:10,872
Except to point out
that Harvey dent is still alive.

391
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:16,127
Because I allow it.

392
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:17,504
For now.

393
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:21,049
This...

394
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:23,426
This is what I keep talking about.

395
00:38:23,593 --> 00:38:25,053
This is Oxford.

396
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:27,138
That place polluted your mind, Alberto.

397
00:38:27,514 --> 00:38:29,891
You used to know your place. Now?

398
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,477
I should have never sent you there.

399
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:39,108
The dangers of independent thought.

400
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:43,196
When have you had
one independent thought

401
00:38:43,363 --> 00:38:45,448
that actually benefited this family?

402
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:49,828
Maybe when I sent flowers
to dent's hospital room

403
00:38:49,911 --> 00:38:51,079
in the Falcone name.

404
00:38:52,956 --> 00:38:54,499
You did what?

405
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:58,294
I sent rowers.

406
00:38:58,378 --> 00:39:00,380
I thought it would
take suspicion off of us

407
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:02,423
if we looked like we care
about his recovery.

408
00:39:02,924 --> 00:39:05,426
Now, I suppose you'll say
it was a sloppy move.

409
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:14,435
I can forgive sloppy.

410
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:17,772
What I will not tolerate,

411
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:21,109
is you presuming to speak
on behalf of this family.

412
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:29,284
Let me be perfectly clear.

413
00:39:29,951 --> 00:39:30,951
Again.

414
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:37,876
Any notion you may hold
about being next in line

415
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:40,545
to take over our business interests

416
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:42,714
is a pathetic delusion.

417
00:39:51,723 --> 00:39:53,141
You are weak.

418
00:39:53,308 --> 00:39:56,269
Your weakness is my liability.

419
00:39:56,561 --> 00:40:01,065
You are to have zero contact
with Mr. or Mrs. Harvey dent.

420
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:03,610
End of discussion.

421
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:57,454
Harvey!

422
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:04,962
Hello.

423
00:41:06,506 --> 00:41:08,758
I got a call that you went
missing from the hospital.

424
00:41:11,344 --> 00:41:12,845
How did I know I'd find you here?

425
00:41:14,931 --> 00:41:17,350
Couldn't stand being cooped up anymore.

426
00:41:17,767 --> 00:41:19,936
Thought I'd stretch my legs.

427
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:21,019
Yeah.

428
00:41:21,521 --> 00:41:24,107
Listen, why don't you hop in?
I'll take you back.

429
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:26,818
Oh, no. No. No. No. No.
I like it out here.

430
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:31,781
I'm on my way home
for Thanksgiving dinner.

431
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:34,909
You should come along.
Barbara always makes a ton.

432
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:36,035
I'm not hungry.

433
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:43,167
Harvey, what are we doing here?

434
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:48,756
I don't know.
Maybe I wasn't ready for this yet.

435
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:51,718
I think I'm gonna go back now.

436
00:41:52,552 --> 00:41:54,804
Don't you worry about Harvey.

437
00:41:57,098 --> 00:41:59,142
All right, counselor.

438
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:07,483
As far as I'm concerned,
you don't have this.

439
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:14,574
The falcones are dangerous people
and, to them, you're the bad guy.

440
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:16,242
Protect your family.

441
00:42:30,131 --> 00:42:32,592
So, I made him an offer, you know.

442
00:42:40,433 --> 00:42:41,517
To the family.

443
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:43,519
Those dearly departed...

444
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:49,150
And those whom we are fortunate
to have beside us here today.

445
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:52,612
Let us be thankful for the time
we still have together

446
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:55,531
and for the many blessings
bestowed upon us.

447
00:42:57,784 --> 00:43:00,703
- Alla salute!
- Salute!

448
00:43:11,923 --> 00:43:13,007
Ah, yes.

449
00:43:14,759 --> 00:43:16,070
- Oh, look.
- Oh, come here!

450
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:17,553
- Oh-ho!
- Yeah!

451
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:20,807
- I told you I'd walk.
- Very good. Very good.

452
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:22,809
Yeah!

453
00:43:23,518 --> 00:43:24,518
Whoo-hoo!

454
00:43:24,769 --> 00:43:26,062
Welcome back.

455
00:43:39,325 --> 00:43:40,325
Barbara?

456
00:43:58,386 --> 00:43:59,386
Ooh!

457
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:32,253
Solomon grundy...

458
00:44:33,171 --> 00:44:36,048
Born on a Monday...

459
00:44:43,973 --> 00:44:47,226
Believe me, I told him
where he could stick the cape.

460
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:50,897
Even Gordon laughed.

461
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:53,983
That's when they let me go.

462
00:45:26,641 --> 00:45:29,602
You don't need me for this.
I should be out hunting.

463
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:31,395
We've got it covered.

464
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:34,982
All of Gotham pd will be deployed
throughout town by midnight.

465
00:45:37,777 --> 00:45:41,656
One way or another, when holiday
comes calling, we'll be ready.

466
00:45:43,908 --> 00:45:45,785
You know, this was all you.

467
00:45:46,661 --> 00:45:48,746
I wanted them
in Gotham penitentiary.

468
00:45:49,789 --> 00:45:53,084
This was Harvey. And he was right.

469
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:01,801
Calendar man.

470
00:46:05,346 --> 00:46:07,765
A killer who only works on holidays.

471
00:46:09,475 --> 00:46:11,352
And it's December 24th.

472
00:46:13,271 --> 00:46:15,731
I was wondering when you'd get to me.

473
00:46:15,815 --> 00:46:17,608
We don't have much time, day.

474
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:20,444
Who killed Johnny viti on Halloween?

475
00:46:20,987 --> 00:46:25,032
The same person who killed Mickey chen
and his crew on Thanksgiving.

476
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:28,160
We need a better answer than that.

477
00:46:28,577 --> 00:46:30,454
Viti was the Roman's nephew.

478
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:33,374
The Roman was chen's employer.

479
00:46:34,417 --> 00:46:36,335
First suspect is, therefore,

480
00:46:37,003 --> 00:46:38,003
the Roman.

481
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:46,595
But since sneaking around
isn't really Falcone's ster,

482
00:46:46,679 --> 00:46:48,723
we move on to the second suspect.

483
00:46:50,182 --> 00:46:53,436
Someone hoping for the fall
of the Roman empire.

484
00:46:55,104 --> 00:46:56,439
Like sal maroni.

485
00:46:57,273 --> 00:46:59,233
He's as good a guess
as any of the others.

486
00:47:00,776 --> 00:47:01,861
What "others"?

487
00:47:03,988 --> 00:47:05,239
You're down a man.

488
00:47:07,033 --> 00:47:08,409
This is a waste of time.

489
00:47:09,118 --> 00:47:10,745
I told you to bring Mr. Dent.

490
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:13,080
He isn't safe out there.

491
00:47:14,582 --> 00:47:16,667
The da who put you all in arkham?

492
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:18,753
Half the patients here
would kill him on sight,

493
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:22,757
so, I'd say out there
is the only place he is safe.

494
00:47:24,884 --> 00:47:25,884
Perhaps.

495
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:28,679
Or perhaps he doesn't know you're here.

496
00:47:30,348 --> 00:47:31,390
Perhaps...

497
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:35,811
The district attorney...

498
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:39,065
Is a suspect.

499
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:52,578
Well, of course.
Intelligent, calculating,

500
00:47:52,661 --> 00:47:55,748
with a mission
to take down carmine Falcone.

501
00:47:56,624 --> 00:47:57,708
It all fits.

502
00:47:57,875 --> 00:47:59,668
Harvey dent is not a killer.

503
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:04,673
Unless he's leading a double life.

504
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:08,761
Like your caped crusader, here.

505
00:48:08,844 --> 00:48:11,347
Why did you ask for me?

506
00:48:11,514 --> 00:48:13,349
So you could see for yourself.

507
00:48:15,351 --> 00:48:17,269
I don't have time for your crazy.

508
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:20,189
You really don't.

509
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:24,318
There's lots of crazy
out there these days.

510
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:29,907
And just when you thought
you'd cleaned it all up.

511
00:48:31,409 --> 00:48:32,910
What a...

512
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:35,578
Joke.

513
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:46,549
Happy holiday.

514
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:49,009
Open it!

515
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:08,565
He had somebody get to my kid!

516
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:10,573
If... if I didn't help him.

517
00:49:11,323 --> 00:49:12,491
I'm sorry.

518
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:14,785
Harvey isn't safe.

519
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:33,721
'Tis the season to be jolly

520
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:37,266
ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha-ha!

521
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:41,353
Outside it's an awful chiller

522
00:49:41,437 --> 00:49:44,315
ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha-ha!

523
00:49:45,274 --> 00:49:48,486
Boy, this holiday's a killer

524
00:49:48,569 --> 00:49:51,822
ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha-ha!

525
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:53,949
Gilda? Is that you?

526
00:49:56,118 --> 00:49:57,244
"Gilda"!

527
00:49:59,622 --> 00:50:01,707
She looked like a gilda.

528
00:50:05,794 --> 00:50:07,254
Looking for this?

529
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:12,801
Relax, lollipop!

530
00:50:13,385 --> 00:50:15,596
Police issue.

531
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:16,972
Where's my wife?

532
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:21,602
She's just where I left her,
last-minute shopping.

533
00:50:24,313 --> 00:50:27,441
Spoiler alert. It's socks.

534
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:28,859
What do you want?

535
00:50:31,153 --> 00:50:34,323
Aww, I thought
I was playing santi claus!

536
00:50:34,406 --> 00:50:36,283
Oh, all right.

537
00:50:36,617 --> 00:50:39,870
I want a fire engine
and a football and...

538
00:50:39,954 --> 00:50:42,498
To deliver a message.

539
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:47,878
Put the gun down and we'll talk.

540
00:50:50,673 --> 00:50:51,673
Sure!

541
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:06,665
Your suspicions were correct.

542
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:10,192
A Santa clown has reportedly terrorized
three families today.

543
00:51:10,693 --> 00:51:13,279
Sir, they were all named "dent."

544
00:51:21,579 --> 00:51:22,913
Whoo!

545
00:51:43,392 --> 00:51:44,810
Where did you get that?

546
00:51:46,729 --> 00:51:49,106
Ya missin' one?

547
00:51:50,024 --> 00:51:52,359
You could use some cheering up!

548
00:51:52,443 --> 00:51:55,321
Have ya heard the one
about the murderous clown

549
00:51:55,404 --> 00:51:57,072
that escaped the asylum

550
00:51:57,156 --> 00:52:00,659
and showed up at the home of the da
who put him there?

551
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:05,289
See, there's a persistent rumor
'round these parts

552
00:52:05,414 --> 00:52:09,710
that da dent
is more than he appears to be.

553
00:52:11,253 --> 00:52:14,923
But there's only room for one
homicidal maniac in this town.

554
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:19,845
And if I hear that happy Harvey dent
is steppin' out,

555
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:23,891
I'll make sure little gilda
doesn't have to clothes-shop

556
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:26,352
for hubby-wubby ever again.

557
00:52:27,603 --> 00:52:29,104
You call that a joke?

558
00:52:30,689 --> 00:52:33,025
But you haven't even
heard the punchline!

559
00:52:33,108 --> 00:52:34,485
It goes like this!

560
00:52:43,035 --> 00:52:44,035
Harvey.

561
00:52:45,663 --> 00:52:46,955
Harvey, can you hear me?

562
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:50,668
Any idea where he was heading?

563
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:53,920
Maroni...

564
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:57,049
Mangia.

565
00:53:19,238 --> 00:53:21,448
What happened to your
friend's face, maroni?

566
00:53:21,532 --> 00:53:23,283
Nothin'. What happened to yours?

567
00:53:23,367 --> 00:53:24,407
Oh, you mother...

568
00:53:24,451 --> 00:53:26,704
Tell me everything he said.

569
00:53:27,371 --> 00:53:29,331
If you get off of my neck.

570
00:53:36,004 --> 00:53:38,006
He was inside before we got there.

571
00:53:38,132 --> 00:53:40,634
Took out the whole staff,
poisoned the fagioli.

572
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:44,138
I wasn't hungry,
but, uh, Freddy, here...

573
00:53:44,763 --> 00:53:46,557
I don't know. Guess I'm lucky.

574
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:49,435
No. He let you live. Why?

575
00:53:49,685 --> 00:53:51,145
Do I look like I know?

576
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:54,148
He put a gun in my face
and told me that this is his turf

577
00:53:54,273 --> 00:53:56,400
and that he's cracking down
on interlopers.

578
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:58,026
Maybe I should thank him.

579
00:54:00,612 --> 00:54:02,406
I don't know where you get off.

580
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:06,201
Freaks like this clown used to play
way out on the fringe,

581
00:54:06,326 --> 00:54:07,619
but once you showed up...

582
00:54:09,955 --> 00:54:10,956
Relax, pal.

583
00:54:15,169 --> 00:54:17,463
Ya know, things used to
run smooth in this town.

584
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:22,301
Now, we got killer crocs
and moths and sewer zombies,

585
00:54:22,384 --> 00:54:24,762
not to mention a homicidal maniac

586
00:54:24,845 --> 00:54:27,723
skulking around the holidays
hittin' made men.

587
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:33,896
What's the common thread? Huh.

588
00:54:34,521 --> 00:54:36,023
Where is he?

589
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:38,066
Who knows? He's a nutjob.

590
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:40,319
But if he's the guy
killin' Falcone's men,

591
00:54:40,402 --> 00:54:43,322
it's only a matter of time
till he gets to old carmine himself.

592
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:44,782
Maybe start there.

593
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:49,453
Not really much of a detective, are ya?

594
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:16,020
Hello.

595
00:55:33,705 --> 00:55:36,959
Navy, Navy, charcoal, black.

596
00:55:38,627 --> 00:55:42,214
Really, carm, is a splash
of color too much to ask?

597
00:55:42,631 --> 00:55:46,134
Stop clowning around.
If you're gonna kill me, just do it.

598
00:55:47,636 --> 00:55:50,514
Is this the face of a killer?

599
00:55:54,810 --> 00:55:56,478
Ugh!

600
00:55:56,645 --> 00:55:57,938
I guess it is!

601
00:56:00,315 --> 00:56:03,902
Oh, relax, polpetto,
I'm not going to kill you.

602
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:06,905
Not tonight, anyway.

603
00:56:06,989 --> 00:56:09,032
It's Christmas!

604
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:10,700
But...

605
00:56:11,618 --> 00:56:14,746
Someone will die tonight.

606
00:56:14,872 --> 00:56:17,332
Probably someone close to you.

607
00:56:17,708 --> 00:56:20,586
Don't you want to know
who's pulling the trigger?

608
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:25,799
Anyhoo, I just popped in to say,

609
00:56:25,883 --> 00:56:29,136
if you hear any news about
the holiday investigation,

610
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:31,597
I'd like you to pass it my way.

611
00:56:33,098 --> 00:56:35,392
As a professional courtesy.

612
00:56:36,768 --> 00:56:38,562
Here's my card!

613
00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:42,816
Buon natale!

614
00:56:47,279 --> 00:56:48,739
Buon natale.

615
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:50,407
Hoo!

616
00:56:50,574 --> 00:56:51,700
I kill me.

617
00:56:59,291 --> 00:57:00,292
What the hell?

618
00:57:11,595 --> 00:57:12,595
Missed me!

619
00:57:15,182 --> 00:57:17,309
Whoo!

620
00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:24,441
You know what I forgot?

621
00:57:39,539 --> 00:57:42,250
Whoa!
That was close.

622
00:57:46,171 --> 00:57:48,131
Whee!

623
00:58:53,905 --> 00:58:55,323
I would remind you, sir,

624
00:58:55,407 --> 00:58:58,952
of Mr. Falcone's annual benefit
for the Gotham children's clinic.

625
00:58:59,578 --> 00:59:02,914
It would be advisable to show your face
at least one year.

626
00:59:03,623 --> 00:59:05,751
Your father built that hospital.

627
00:59:05,834 --> 00:59:07,586
He helped the Roman build it.

628
00:59:08,587 --> 00:59:10,505
Still, a good cause.

629
00:59:10,589 --> 00:59:13,425
And, frankly, a night on a yacht
could do you some good.

630
00:59:14,092 --> 00:59:15,552
Miss Kyle will be there.

631
00:59:19,848 --> 00:59:21,933
Three murders on three holidays.

632
00:59:22,601 --> 00:59:24,811
Each of the victims
a Falcone associate.

633
00:59:24,895 --> 00:59:27,272
All shot with the same type
of untraceable gun.

634
00:59:27,439 --> 00:59:28,439
No witnesses.

635
00:59:29,274 --> 00:59:30,275
Suspects?

636
00:59:31,651 --> 00:59:33,779
Salvatore maroni.

637
00:59:33,945 --> 00:59:36,448
His family's always been
second to the Roman.

638
00:59:36,823 --> 00:59:38,867
He's notoriously ambitious.

639
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:41,745
But he's killed Falcone's men
in broad daylight.

640
00:59:41,828 --> 00:59:44,122
Why the cloak-and-dagger
holiday business?

641
00:59:45,165 --> 00:59:47,292
Carla viti, Falcone's sister.

642
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:49,628
Runs their Chicago operation.

643
00:59:49,711 --> 00:59:52,047
She could be making a play
for control of the family.

644
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:54,966
By killing
her only son on Halloween?

645
00:59:55,050 --> 00:59:56,301
She is a criminal.

646
00:59:57,094 --> 01:00:00,097
And he is a homicidal maniac.

647
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:03,141
The guard testified that
he escaped before the first murder.

648
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:05,727
The Roman himself.

649
01:00:05,977 --> 01:00:07,979
Johnny viti was about to flip

650
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:11,191
and Mickey chen could testify
that Falcone ordered dent's murder.

651
01:00:11,691 --> 01:00:14,069
He had motive to silence them both.

652
01:00:14,236 --> 01:00:16,238
But why kill his own bodyguard?

653
01:00:16,321 --> 01:00:19,825
May I ask why you're keeping
the fifth suspect off the board?

654
01:00:20,992 --> 01:00:22,272
Because I don't like it.

655
01:00:23,203 --> 01:00:25,330
But it fits. Doesn't it?

656
01:00:26,581 --> 01:00:28,917
Obsessed with taking down Falcone.

657
01:00:29,042 --> 01:00:32,754
More than boss maroni
and every ambitious made man in town.

658
01:00:32,838 --> 01:00:35,590
He was turned down
for a gun license last year,

659
01:00:35,674 --> 01:00:38,844
when the psych eval showed some
wild aberrations.

660
01:00:40,846 --> 01:00:42,556
Or is it someone else entirely?

661
01:00:43,515 --> 01:00:45,475
Someone we haven't even considered.

662
01:00:47,018 --> 01:00:49,938
I thought this would be about sweeping
criminals off the street,

663
01:00:50,105 --> 01:00:52,023
maybe scaring them straight.

664
01:00:52,732 --> 01:00:56,194
I never thought that Batman
was going to have to be a detective.

665
01:00:56,278 --> 01:00:57,278
A good one.

666
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:01,825
What if I can't save them, Alfred?

667
01:01:02,993 --> 01:01:05,954
I've seen these growing pains
before, sir,

668
01:01:06,037 --> 01:01:08,373
and I am confident that, in the end,

669
01:01:08,456 --> 01:01:11,543
the Batman will be
what the world needs him to be.

670
01:01:13,753 --> 01:01:16,548
The same, I believe,
should be said of Bruce Wayne.

671
01:01:42,782 --> 01:01:44,201
My distinguished guests,

672
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:47,370
it is my honor to welcome
you here tonight.

673
01:01:48,413 --> 01:01:51,374
I see a lot of familiar faces. Mayor.

674
01:01:54,169 --> 01:01:55,253
Your eminence.

675
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:00,300
No, I was talking to sal maroni.

676
01:02:05,138 --> 01:02:07,599
Sal maroni. On my yacht.

677
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:12,020
It's like my father always said,
"keep your enemies close...

678
01:02:12,771 --> 01:02:14,314
And a loaded gun closer."

679
01:02:19,778 --> 01:02:20,695
Yeah.

680
01:02:20,779 --> 01:02:23,949
Thirty years ago,
a small group of concerned gothamites

681
01:02:24,032 --> 01:02:25,617
joined together to build something

682
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:29,162
the politicians squabbling
in the halls of government could not.

683
01:02:30,247 --> 01:02:31,623
Dr. Thomas Wayne and I

684
01:02:31,706 --> 01:02:34,584
built the children's clinic
to protect families.

685
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:36,461
And if you know me,

686
01:02:36,795 --> 01:02:41,466
you know there is nothing
more important to me than family.

687
01:02:42,509 --> 01:02:44,052
So, buon anno!

688
01:02:44,177 --> 01:02:47,264
Thank you all for being here
and for your generosity.

689
01:02:47,847 --> 01:02:49,349
Let's beat last year's total.

690
01:02:50,183 --> 01:02:52,852
Remember, cash only, please.

691
01:03:04,197 --> 01:03:07,575
Also, I would like to thank
our corporate sponsors,

692
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:09,035
kord omniversal,

693
01:03:09,411 --> 01:03:10,453
soder cola,

694
01:03:10,954 --> 01:03:14,582
and, for the 10th year running,
Gotham broadcasting company.

695
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:17,127
Oh! Oh.

696
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:19,170
I'm so sorry!

697
01:03:19,254 --> 01:03:20,254
Here, let me.

698
01:03:20,297 --> 01:03:21,923
I have it. Thank you.

699
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:25,885
No, thank you.

700
01:03:25,969 --> 01:03:29,431
One more thing, and then
I promise I'll let you enjoy the party.

701
01:03:30,348 --> 01:03:32,225
I would like to acknowledge someone.

702
01:03:32,309 --> 01:03:35,812
As I said, nothing is more
important to me than family.

703
01:03:36,438 --> 01:03:38,398
And, perhaps, my one regret

704
01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:43,528
is making this man feel like
he is not a part of this family.

705
01:03:44,321 --> 01:03:46,406
We have not always agreed on details.

706
01:03:48,116 --> 01:03:51,786
But we agree
on the most important things.

707
01:03:52,370 --> 01:03:54,331
We believe in family.

708
01:03:57,083 --> 01:03:59,919
We believe in business.

709
01:04:00,295 --> 01:04:01,838
And, like all of you here tonight,

710
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:06,009
we believe in Gotham city.

711
01:04:07,469 --> 01:04:10,805
Ladies and gentlemen,
the son I never had...

712
01:04:11,765 --> 01:04:12,932
Mr. Bruce Wayne.

713
01:04:50,011 --> 01:04:52,011
- I think I see them!
- Wh-what?

714
01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:55,475
As if it matters.
I hardly ever see you, anyway.

715
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:57,394
I'm just saying, there's no need to...

716
01:04:57,477 --> 01:04:58,770
Hey, Harvey!

717
01:05:05,235 --> 01:05:07,112
Shouldn't you be working, captain?

718
01:05:07,278 --> 01:05:08,278
I am.

719
01:05:08,738 --> 01:05:11,783
This is the largest police presence
this city's ever seen.

720
01:05:11,866 --> 01:05:13,785
We got caught with our
pants down on Christmas,

721
01:05:13,868 --> 01:05:16,287
but heaven help holiday
if he tries anything here tonight.

722
01:05:19,874 --> 01:05:21,793
Always on duty.

723
01:05:21,876 --> 01:05:22,876
Always.

724
01:05:23,586 --> 01:05:25,004
You didn't bring the kids?

725
01:05:25,380 --> 01:05:27,424
They're sleeping over
at my mother's tonight.

726
01:05:27,507 --> 01:05:30,343
We should try and hire you
to sit next time, gilda.

727
01:05:30,427 --> 01:05:32,387
I bet you're great with kids.

728
01:05:32,470 --> 01:05:34,639
I haven't worked as a sitter in years.

729
01:05:34,889 --> 01:05:37,350
It paid her way
through law school.

730
01:05:37,851 --> 01:05:39,102
I didn't know you're a lawyer.

731
01:05:39,394 --> 01:05:40,394
I was.

732
01:05:41,396 --> 01:05:42,564
Now, I'm not anything.

733
01:05:48,486 --> 01:05:50,155
Dead pilot? Check.

734
01:05:51,823 --> 01:05:53,950
Ground crew? Check.

735
01:05:55,535 --> 01:05:58,663
Poison gas? Check.

736
01:06:00,415 --> 01:06:03,042
Time to ring in the new year.

737
01:06:10,508 --> 01:06:14,387
Ladies and gentlemen,
please fasten your seat belts,

738
01:06:14,471 --> 01:06:18,683
as I have no idea how to fly this thing!

739
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:36,618
Looks like a real party.

740
01:06:36,701 --> 01:06:38,828
So, what the hell are we doing here?

741
01:06:39,454 --> 01:06:40,454
I don't know.

742
01:06:42,081 --> 01:06:44,292
Something tells me
this is where I need to be tonight.

743
01:06:49,547 --> 01:06:51,549
We...

744
01:06:51,633 --> 01:06:54,302
Look, we haven't talked,
and I think we should.

745
01:06:55,970 --> 01:06:57,680
I feel like whatever this is...

746
01:06:58,097 --> 01:07:02,685
Whatever we've tried to be to
one another is... unraveling.

747
01:07:04,229 --> 01:07:05,855
And we both know why.

748
01:07:08,066 --> 01:07:09,400
We've never spoken of it,

749
01:07:09,484 --> 01:07:13,238
but the truth is that
you and I are two different people.

750
01:07:14,656 --> 01:07:16,324
It was fun to try...

751
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:20,411
But I don't think we're ever
gonna be able to put it all together.

752
01:07:21,871 --> 01:07:24,541
I guess we're just not cut out for...

753
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:26,668
Whatever this is.

754
01:07:27,835 --> 01:07:28,878
Was.

755
01:07:38,763 --> 01:07:42,684
Don't worry, though.
I'll see you on the other side.

756
01:07:54,612 --> 01:07:55,780
When did you do it?

757
01:07:56,781 --> 01:07:57,949
Do what?

758
01:07:58,533 --> 01:08:01,452
You took my watch without me noticing.

759
01:08:01,536 --> 01:08:03,663
So, when did you do it? I'm curious.

760
01:08:05,331 --> 01:08:06,583
Take it from me, Bruce,

761
01:08:07,375 --> 01:08:10,628
around here,
curiosity can get you killed.

762
01:08:19,554 --> 01:08:20,554
Not now.

763
01:08:23,016 --> 01:08:24,016
What?

764
01:08:25,059 --> 01:08:26,059
Where?

765
01:08:31,649 --> 01:08:34,569
I just want to have a normal night.
Can we just have a normal night?

766
01:08:34,986 --> 01:08:37,113
I don't even know what that is anymore.

767
01:08:38,072 --> 01:08:39,949
I am alone here.

768
01:08:41,826 --> 01:08:44,537
I told myself it was okay
because it would get better,

769
01:08:44,621 --> 01:08:46,331
but it hasn't.

770
01:08:46,831 --> 01:08:48,791
You don't have to be alone.

771
01:08:48,875 --> 01:08:51,169
We've talked about having a baby.

772
01:08:51,544 --> 01:08:54,422
I can't! You know that I can't!

773
01:08:54,756 --> 01:08:56,215
Maybe not the old-fashioned way,

774
01:08:56,299 --> 01:08:57,901
but that doesn't mean
that we can't try something...

775
01:08:57,925 --> 01:08:59,677
I don't want it.

776
01:08:59,761 --> 01:09:03,556
I don't want it because I can't
and I can't because I don't want it.

777
01:09:04,932 --> 01:09:07,060
Can we please
talk about this in private?

778
01:09:09,187 --> 01:09:11,648
Jesus, why can't you be more like...

779
01:09:13,816 --> 01:09:15,401
More like who?

780
01:09:20,031 --> 01:09:21,699
I'm only one man.

781
01:09:21,783 --> 01:09:22,867
I can't do this.

782
01:09:24,035 --> 01:09:25,119
Not now.

783
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:30,249
Excuse us.

784
01:09:33,252 --> 01:09:36,381
Jim, did you know they're
having these kinds of problems?

785
01:09:37,090 --> 01:09:38,007
Jim?

786
01:09:38,091 --> 01:09:39,592
Yeah. I see it now.

787
01:09:39,676 --> 01:09:40,677
Huh?

788
01:09:41,969 --> 01:09:43,805
What's going on?

789
01:09:46,766 --> 01:09:48,059
Crappy new year!

790
01:10:00,321 --> 01:10:01,322
Hey.

791
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:20,466
Should all offenses he forgot
and never brought to trial...

792
01:10:22,260 --> 01:10:26,180
Oh, silly me. The safety. Ha!

793
01:10:29,851 --> 01:10:34,188
Ooh, pretty.

794
01:10:43,448 --> 01:10:44,782
Huh?

795
01:10:49,954 --> 01:10:51,581
Well, shit.

796
01:10:58,421 --> 01:11:01,674
Economy class
ain't what she used to be. Ha!

797
01:11:08,306 --> 01:11:09,825
This area needs to be clear!

798
01:11:09,849 --> 01:11:11,434
Everyone remain calm.

799
01:11:11,517 --> 01:11:12,517
This way!

800
01:11:14,353 --> 01:11:16,355
- Pearce!
- Captain, sir!

801
01:11:16,606 --> 01:11:18,149
I need to get my wife out of here.

802
01:11:18,733 --> 01:11:20,902
Yes, sir! Follow me, ma'am.

803
01:11:43,925 --> 01:11:46,177
What are you trying to prove
with this stunt, joker?

804
01:11:46,677 --> 01:11:49,180
Prove? Stunt? Joker?

805
01:11:49,305 --> 01:11:51,390
No, wait, that one's right.

806
01:11:51,474 --> 01:11:53,309
- Why did you kill Johnny viti?
- What?

807
01:11:53,392 --> 01:11:55,645
And Mickey chen and milos grappa?

808
01:11:55,978 --> 01:11:58,773
You think I'm holiday?

809
01:11:58,856 --> 01:12:03,319
Oh, poppet, I didn't know you cared.

810
01:12:07,657 --> 01:12:09,033
Of course I'm not holiday!

811
01:12:09,116 --> 01:12:11,869
If I were him,
why would I be trying to kill him?

812
01:12:12,411 --> 01:12:13,412
Kill him?

813
01:12:13,621 --> 01:12:15,540
He's the competition!

814
01:12:15,623 --> 01:12:18,251
And, like the corn kernel always says,

815
01:12:18,334 --> 01:12:20,795
"I won't be number two."

816
01:12:29,637 --> 01:12:31,138
If it's holiday you want dead...

817
01:12:32,014 --> 01:12:34,308
Then why gas everyone in Gotham square?

818
01:12:34,517 --> 01:12:36,561
Half the city's down there,

819
01:12:36,644 --> 01:12:40,398
which means holiday either is, or isn't!

820
01:12:40,481 --> 01:12:42,859
I have a 50-50 chance.

821
01:12:42,942 --> 01:12:47,071
And if I fail, well, at least
I've killed a lot of innocent people.

822
01:12:55,079 --> 01:12:58,499
No, don't kill me!
Not before I find out who holiday is!

823
01:13:00,501 --> 01:13:01,586
Why do you care?

824
01:13:01,794 --> 01:13:04,297
Oh, you adorable fool!

825
01:13:04,672 --> 01:13:08,634
Don't you know by now?
I'm just like you!

826
01:13:08,759 --> 01:13:11,679
We both love a good puzzle.

827
01:13:23,274 --> 01:13:26,152
So, when the clock strikes 12:00,

828
01:13:26,277 --> 01:13:28,446
do I get a little kiss?

829
01:13:40,291 --> 01:13:42,501
Whoop! Taking that as a "no."

830
01:14:11,906 --> 01:14:14,450
There goes my resolution.

831
01:14:19,330 --> 01:14:21,374
Out of the way. Now! Move!

832
01:14:42,186 --> 01:14:43,479
Alberto, right?

833
01:14:46,148 --> 01:14:47,148
Selina.

834
01:14:51,195 --> 01:14:53,280
Can I ask you a question?

835
01:14:53,364 --> 01:14:57,159
I'm trying to imagine what it's like
to grow up around all this.

836
01:14:57,785 --> 01:14:58,786
I wouldn't know.

837
01:14:59,745 --> 01:15:03,708
"Mr. Family" had me in boarding schools
overseas before I could walk.

838
01:15:04,458 --> 01:15:07,753
Which is fine.
I would have never fit in here, anyway.

839
01:15:08,796 --> 01:15:12,216
I'm an Oxford graduate
who's learned more about business

840
01:15:12,299 --> 01:15:15,636
than my father could ever
hope to understand, yet...

841
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:17,596
You don't get a seat at the table.

842
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:21,267
Because I'm "weak." I fell in love.

843
01:15:22,309 --> 01:15:23,602
How is that weak?

844
01:15:24,645 --> 01:15:28,024
She was the wrong woman.
Wrong for the family.

845
01:15:28,899 --> 01:15:31,444
Wrong for him.

846
01:15:31,527 --> 01:15:34,572
And, back then,
I was so desperate for his approval.

847
01:15:36,657 --> 01:15:37,867
What happened to her?

848
01:15:40,453 --> 01:15:41,954
Terrible things.

849
01:15:42,038 --> 01:15:44,790
I let him scare her away from me.

850
01:15:44,874 --> 01:15:48,711
Which, ironically, only proved that he
was right about me in the first place.

851
01:15:50,212 --> 01:15:52,381
Weak. An embarrassment.

852
01:15:54,050 --> 01:15:55,634
I'm sorry, I don't mean to...

853
01:16:00,514 --> 01:16:02,183
Why do I feel like I can talk to you?

854
01:16:02,933 --> 01:16:04,477
Uh, I, um...

855
01:16:05,936 --> 01:16:06,979
I just...

856
01:16:10,357 --> 01:16:12,818
Oh, no. No, I'm sorry, I...

857
01:16:13,444 --> 01:16:15,404
I can't... we can't.

858
01:16:15,488 --> 01:16:16,655
Get away from her.

859
01:16:21,869 --> 01:16:22,869
Bruce!

860
01:16:23,287 --> 01:16:26,373
Wait. Bruce? Wayne?

861
01:16:27,124 --> 01:16:29,126
Bruce Wayne is the Batman?

862
01:16:29,460 --> 01:16:32,171
And Alberto Falcone is holiday.

863
01:16:32,254 --> 01:16:33,923
Surprises all around.

864
01:16:34,173 --> 01:16:36,967
Me? You've been fed
some bad clues, Bruce.

865
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:39,845
But I still solved the puzzle.

866
01:16:40,471 --> 01:16:42,431
The rejected son,

867
01:16:42,515 --> 01:16:45,684
born to inherit an empire,
but cast aside.

868
01:16:46,685 --> 01:16:47,853
You're wrong.

869
01:16:48,312 --> 01:16:51,273
You knew you'd never be
handed the keys to the kingdom,

870
01:16:51,357 --> 01:16:55,027
so you manufactured a crisis
that targets the family business.

871
01:16:55,111 --> 01:16:56,320
What?

872
01:16:56,529 --> 01:16:59,198
With potential successors
dropping like flies,

873
01:16:59,281 --> 01:17:01,617
poppa tightened the circle
to family only,

874
01:17:01,700 --> 01:17:04,787
and, for the first time,
you were on the inside.

875
01:17:06,747 --> 01:17:09,333
I don't want control of the family!

876
01:17:09,458 --> 01:17:10,501
I never did!

877
01:17:10,584 --> 01:17:15,256
Ten! Nine! Eight!
Seven! Six! Five!

878
01:17:15,339 --> 01:17:16,465
Four! Three!

879
01:17:16,549 --> 01:17:18,384
I would happily trade
that for a normal life!

880
01:17:18,467 --> 01:17:20,594
To spend my days as far away
from Gotham as possible.

881
01:17:20,678 --> 01:17:21,780
Two! One! Happy new year!

882
01:17:21,804 --> 01:17:23,681
To get married, and have a child with...

883
01:17:23,764 --> 01:17:25,004
{gunshofl -

884
01:17:32,439 --> 01:17:33,566
Oh, my god!

885
01:17:55,337 --> 01:17:56,839
You couldn't know.

886
01:17:57,965 --> 01:17:59,884
You're missing so many pieces.

887
01:19:55,124 --> 01:19:56,124
Come on.

888
01:20:01,297 --> 01:20:03,048
Jim, what the hell are we doing?

889
01:20:09,263 --> 01:20:13,183
The divers will be fishing out
parts ofalberto Falcone for days.

890
01:20:13,267 --> 01:20:15,436
Five-bladed prop
on its slowest speed.

891
01:20:16,103 --> 01:20:17,271
Hell of a way to go.

892
01:20:17,354 --> 01:20:18,856
That isn't how he went.

893
01:20:19,648 --> 01:20:23,110
He was shot by holiday
before going overboard.

894
01:20:23,444 --> 01:20:26,322
Hang on. Alberto wasn't holiday?

895
01:20:26,613 --> 01:20:27,948
I thought he was.

896
01:20:28,032 --> 01:20:30,826
It was occam's razor, Jim,
the simplest solution.

897
01:20:32,036 --> 01:20:33,036
But it was wrong.

898
01:20:35,372 --> 01:20:37,082
I went there for Alberto Falcone.

899
01:20:38,792 --> 01:20:40,794
I thought I was supposed to stop him,

900
01:20:41,211 --> 01:20:43,797
but I was supposed to save him.

901
01:20:45,883 --> 01:20:48,594
He was innocent. And now he's dead.

902
01:20:50,971 --> 01:20:52,681
I needed to be better.

903
01:20:54,683 --> 01:20:55,893
We all did.

904
01:20:57,061 --> 01:20:58,061
All of us.

905
01:20:59,855 --> 01:21:02,566
You have to put a protective detail
on carmine Falcone.

906
01:21:02,691 --> 01:21:04,193
If he'll even let you.

907
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:07,946
Do you realize we started out
trying to take down the Roman,

908
01:21:08,030 --> 01:21:09,948
and, now, we're trying to save him?

909
01:21:10,032 --> 01:21:11,784
When did that happen?

910
01:21:11,867 --> 01:21:13,118
I have a better question.

911
01:21:13,202 --> 01:21:17,247
If Alberto Falcone wasn't holiday...
Then who is?

912
01:21:18,207 --> 01:21:19,416
And who's next?

913
01:21:41,063 --> 01:21:43,357
Grant that our brother
may sleep here

914
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:45,984
in peace until you awaken him to glory,

915
01:21:46,068 --> 01:21:49,321
for you are the resurrection
and the life.

916
01:21:49,405 --> 01:21:51,573
Then he will see you face to face

917
01:21:52,032 --> 01:21:54,535
and in your light will see light

918
01:21:54,618 --> 01:21:56,787
and know the splendor of god.

919
01:21:57,079 --> 01:21:58,079
Amen.

920
01:21:58,330 --> 01:21:59,623
Amen.

921
01:22:16,473 --> 01:22:17,473
Bruce.

922
01:22:18,267 --> 01:22:19,435
A word.

923
01:22:20,561 --> 01:22:22,938
Carmine. If there's anything I can do.

924
01:22:23,397 --> 01:22:27,276
You know what I want you to do
but, time and time again, you refuse me.

925
01:22:29,403 --> 01:22:32,865
The Wayne foundation isn't a
money-laundering outfit for the mob.

926
01:22:32,948 --> 01:22:35,701
And it won't be,
so long as I'm in control.

927
01:22:39,037 --> 01:22:40,037
Of course.

928
01:22:42,332 --> 01:22:44,126
Oh, how rude of me.

929
01:22:44,209 --> 01:22:46,086
I don't believe you've met my associate.

930
01:22:48,297 --> 01:22:49,297
Charmed.

931
01:23:33,217 --> 01:23:35,052
Tell me this never has to end.

932
01:23:37,346 --> 01:23:40,682
All things wither, Bruce,
but if we're lucky...

933
01:23:41,808 --> 01:23:43,894
Not for a long time.

934
01:23:51,944 --> 01:23:53,362
Aren't you forgetting something?

935
01:24:01,119 --> 01:24:02,119
Again?

936
01:24:43,870 --> 01:24:45,455
I can't resist you.

937
01:24:57,009 --> 01:24:58,635
No man can.

938
01:26:30,727 --> 01:26:32,187
You've been a good boy.

939
01:26:33,438 --> 01:26:36,316
The foundation was such a burden to you,

940
01:26:37,192 --> 01:26:38,610
to us...

941
01:26:40,195 --> 01:26:42,239
Just like the rest of the company.

942
01:26:47,494 --> 01:26:51,164
You know what you have to do
so we can be together.

943
01:27:04,553 --> 01:27:07,514
Mr. Wayne, I think you've overfed
your philodendron.

944
01:28:02,736 --> 01:28:03,904
Stop!

945
01:28:17,083 --> 01:28:20,253
This isn't you, Bruce.
She's controlling you somehow.

946
01:28:23,465 --> 01:28:25,425
Oh, hell. Sorry!

947
01:29:23,984 --> 01:29:26,319
Oh.

948
01:29:34,828 --> 01:29:36,288
How did you know?

949
01:29:36,371 --> 01:29:38,623
Well, you haven't exactly been discreet.

950
01:29:39,416 --> 01:29:43,753
Appearing with Ivy in public
and signing assets over to the Roman.

951
01:29:45,213 --> 01:29:47,340
I'll wake the lawyers, sir.

952
01:29:49,175 --> 01:29:50,635
Police will be here any minute.

953
01:29:50,844 --> 01:29:53,013
Tell them everything you remember
and then get to bed.

954
01:29:53,930 --> 01:29:55,056
You look awful.

955
01:29:56,224 --> 01:29:58,560
I told you, I don't want a partner.

956
01:30:01,021 --> 01:30:03,064
You sure wanted one
these past three months.

957
01:30:04,441 --> 01:30:05,650
Three months?

958
01:30:07,068 --> 01:30:10,322
It took a while to catch the jolly
green jezebel with her guard down.

959
01:30:11,531 --> 01:30:13,950
- And holiday?
- Still at large.

960
01:30:28,214 --> 01:30:30,216
Gilda, I'm sorry.
We'll make the late movie.

961
01:30:30,967 --> 01:30:32,010
I'm looking fonnard to it.

962
01:30:32,844 --> 01:30:34,679
I think I'd like to go home.

963
01:30:35,096 --> 01:30:36,306
Why? We can...

964
01:30:37,641 --> 01:30:39,851
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

965
01:31:00,163 --> 01:31:01,163
Jesus!

966
01:31:03,333 --> 01:31:04,459
Harvey...

967
01:31:09,381 --> 01:31:10,674
You were right.

968
01:31:14,761 --> 01:31:16,805
Chong's been supplying holiday
with his guns.

969
01:31:21,726 --> 01:31:24,854
You should have listened to me, Jim,
moved on this guy sooner.

970
01:31:25,438 --> 01:31:26,815
We might have learned something.

971
01:31:27,399 --> 01:31:30,193
The holiday killer's
covering his tracks.

972
01:31:34,197 --> 01:31:35,198
Mother's day.

973
01:31:36,074 --> 01:31:37,283
This one snuck up on us.

974
01:31:38,410 --> 01:31:39,494
Sure did.

975
01:31:41,287 --> 01:31:42,497
Where's our friend?

976
01:32:15,864 --> 01:32:17,240
Who helped you escape?

977
01:32:17,574 --> 01:32:19,494
Give me a name or I'll...

978
01:32:56,196 --> 01:32:58,531
It was my mother.

979
01:32:59,616 --> 01:33:01,993
That's who helped me.

980
01:33:02,994 --> 01:33:06,498
I strangled the old witch years ago,

981
01:33:06,998 --> 01:33:13,421
but I think she still watches over
handsome little jonny.

982
01:33:22,680 --> 01:33:25,683
Happy mother's day.

983
01:33:26,017 --> 01:33:27,352
Party time.

984
01:33:35,151 --> 01:33:36,402
Mother.

985
01:33:47,789 --> 01:33:48,832
Through here.

986
01:33:54,295 --> 01:33:56,256
Sweetheart,
I don't know if this is the...

987
01:33:58,508 --> 01:33:59,509
Take what you want.

988
01:34:00,301 --> 01:34:01,469
Don't hurt us.

989
01:35:07,785 --> 01:35:08,785
Is he okay?

990
01:35:09,287 --> 01:35:10,622
I don't care. Let's go.

991
01:35:22,467 --> 01:35:23,676
Bruce, what are you doing?

992
01:35:29,766 --> 01:35:30,934
Mother?

993
01:35:32,101 --> 01:35:33,228
We have to get you home.

994
01:35:43,988 --> 01:35:45,198
Bruce!

995
01:35:46,449 --> 01:35:47,784
Where is she, Alfred?

996
01:35:49,369 --> 01:35:52,330
- She?
- My mother.

997
01:35:53,957 --> 01:35:55,375
I was with my mother.

998
01:36:03,049 --> 01:36:04,801
Up we go.

999
01:36:17,689 --> 01:36:19,708
Gotham police
are searching for two inmates

1000
01:36:19,732 --> 01:36:22,193
that escaped
from arkham asylum last night.

1001
01:36:22,277 --> 01:36:25,697
One of them,
Dr. Jonathan crane, aka the scarecrow...

1002
01:36:26,531 --> 01:36:29,033
Stole one of arkham's horses
from the grounds.

1003
01:36:29,117 --> 01:36:31,286
He's considered extremely dangerous.

1004
01:36:31,369 --> 01:36:33,329
Anyone with knowledge of his whereabouts

1005
01:36:33,413 --> 01:36:36,416
needs to call the Gotham pd hotline
right away.

1006
01:36:36,499 --> 01:36:38,626
Again, he's considered
highly dangerous...

1007
01:36:40,753 --> 01:36:41,753
Wait.

1008
01:36:44,173 --> 01:36:45,300
I packed your lunch.

1009
01:36:51,472 --> 01:36:53,850
Thanks. I gotta go.

1010
01:37:19,584 --> 01:37:21,127
I've come to see my father.

1011
01:37:25,673 --> 01:37:26,758
It's a tie.

1012
01:37:30,136 --> 01:37:32,972
And, yes, my parole officer
knows I'm here.

1013
01:37:45,068 --> 01:37:47,695
Sofia, my little girl.

1014
01:37:49,364 --> 01:37:51,115
Heat give you any trouble downstairs?

1015
01:37:51,824 --> 01:37:55,036
There's more cops here than I ever saw
in ten years on the inside.

1016
01:37:55,119 --> 01:37:59,248
"Holiday detail."
For my protection, or so they tell me.

1017
01:38:00,083 --> 01:38:03,294
- Listen, I'm very busy, so...
- That's why I need to talk to you.

1018
01:38:04,003 --> 01:38:06,672
Papa, I want to be in the room.

1019
01:38:07,298 --> 01:38:09,258
Sofia, we have already discussed...

1020
01:38:09,342 --> 01:38:11,677
I executed the crane escape
like you ordered.

1021
01:38:12,011 --> 01:38:13,763
And this foolish war with sal maroni,

1022
01:38:14,013 --> 01:38:15,223
- I think...
- Basta!

1023
01:38:21,687 --> 01:38:24,273
Things... are strained.

1024
01:38:26,984 --> 01:38:31,030
Half our top earners have been taken out
by either holiday or maroni.

1025
01:38:31,656 --> 01:38:33,324
We had a chance with Wayne,

1026
01:38:34,033 --> 01:38:36,744
but now that he's out,
we have to restructure.

1027
01:38:38,371 --> 01:38:40,832
That is exactly why you need me.

1028
01:38:42,458 --> 01:38:43,543
I do not.

1029
01:38:44,377 --> 01:38:47,296
Sofia, if I bring you in now,

1030
01:38:47,380 --> 01:38:49,966
our new earners will think
I am lining up a successor.

1031
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:54,053
And that will make me look old...
And weak.

1032
01:38:55,805 --> 01:38:57,223
You are neither.

1033
01:38:58,516 --> 01:38:59,851
Nevertheless.

1034
01:39:06,732 --> 01:39:08,985
Good. End of discussion.

1035
01:39:11,237 --> 01:39:12,780
Now go buy something.

1036
01:39:13,823 --> 01:39:16,200
Big, flashy. A dress, a car.

1037
01:39:16,284 --> 01:39:18,703
I don't care.
Just make sure everybody sees it.

1038
01:39:25,501 --> 01:39:27,086
Happy father's day, papa.

1039
01:39:40,224 --> 01:39:42,143
Awful business at first Gotham.

1040
01:39:42,226 --> 01:39:43,728
How do you know it was the scarecrow?

1041
01:39:44,061 --> 01:39:45,646
Crane recently fled arkham.

1042
01:39:46,272 --> 01:39:49,150
Gases all of his victims
with a fear-inducing neurotoxin, so...

1043
01:39:49,233 --> 01:39:50,985
Yeah, you can't really miss him.

1044
01:39:51,068 --> 01:39:52,737
Look, so, Mr. Wayne...

1045
01:39:53,196 --> 01:39:54,530
Uh, it's Bruce.

1046
01:39:55,031 --> 01:39:58,409
Can I get you anything?
Alfred makes a terrific Mai Tai.

1047
01:40:00,828 --> 01:40:02,163
It's 8:30 in the...

1048
01:40:02,955 --> 01:40:05,416
No. No, thank you.

1049
01:40:06,334 --> 01:40:08,503
We have some questions
about new year's Eve.

1050
01:40:09,003 --> 01:40:11,047
The night Alberto Falcone was murdered.

1051
01:40:11,255 --> 01:40:12,608
Harvey here was updating the files,

1052
01:40:12,632 --> 01:40:15,218
and it seems that you were
the only passenger on that yacht

1053
01:40:15,301 --> 01:40:16,636
who didn't give us a statement.

1054
01:40:17,094 --> 01:40:18,304
Afraid I'm not much help.

1055
01:40:18,930 --> 01:40:21,265
I left the party before
all the commotion in a dinghy.

1056
01:40:21,641 --> 01:40:23,434
You probably noticed it was missing.

1057
01:40:24,143 --> 01:40:26,229
Of course, I'd have given you
a statement anyway,

1058
01:40:27,396 --> 01:40:29,649
except that it would have been
a matter of public record

1059
01:40:29,732 --> 01:40:30,816
and could place my name

1060
01:40:30,900 --> 01:40:32,860
next to that of the young lady
I went to meet.

1061
01:40:33,361 --> 01:40:35,404
I don't think her husband
likes me very much.

1062
01:40:35,696 --> 01:40:36,822
That's very convenient.

1063
01:40:37,073 --> 01:40:38,324
Well, not for her husband.

1064
01:40:42,745 --> 01:40:44,497
Here's what I'm trying to understand.

1065
01:40:44,580 --> 01:40:47,500
You recently signed over
significant areas of your business

1066
01:40:47,583 --> 01:40:48,668
to carmine Falcone.

1067
01:40:49,252 --> 01:40:50,711
That's all been reversed.

1068
01:40:51,212 --> 01:40:53,881
And I was drugged and manipulated,
if that's what you mean.

1069
01:40:54,507 --> 01:40:56,300
Was your father drugged and manipulated

1070
01:40:56,384 --> 01:40:58,024
when he went into business
with the Roman?

1071
01:40:58,386 --> 01:41:00,179
You know everything
that monster is today

1072
01:41:00,263 --> 01:41:03,057
was born of the legitimacy
handed him by the name Wayne...

1073
01:41:03,182 --> 01:41:04,183
Harvey.

1074
01:41:04,684 --> 01:41:06,102
It's all right.

1075
01:41:06,185 --> 01:41:08,563
Yes, my father built hospitals
with Falcone.

1076
01:41:10,648 --> 01:41:12,048
But the only influence he was under

1077
01:41:12,108 --> 01:41:14,694
was an ovennhelming desire
to save innocent lives.

1078
01:41:16,445 --> 01:41:19,073
And how many other innocent lives
did he end up trading for it?

1079
01:41:21,242 --> 01:41:23,411
Two... that I know of.

1080
01:41:45,891 --> 01:41:47,691
Please help my son.

1081
01:41:48,060 --> 01:41:49,520
I have nowhere else to go.

1082
01:41:49,645 --> 01:41:50,813
This way. Over here.

1083
01:41:50,896 --> 01:41:52,189
Onto the desk.

1084
01:41:54,150 --> 01:41:58,779
Looks like four...
No, five bullet wounds to the chest.

1085
01:41:59,363 --> 01:42:02,199
You shouldn't have come here.
Your son needs to be in a hospital.

1086
01:42:03,034 --> 01:42:05,786
Where Luigi maroni could find him
and finish the job?

1087
01:42:05,870 --> 01:42:08,581
No, Dr. Wayne, please.

1088
01:42:08,956 --> 01:42:10,833
Carmine is my only son.

1089
01:42:14,170 --> 01:42:15,296
I'll do what I can.

1090
01:42:16,881 --> 01:42:19,300
- Alfred, get my bag.
- Right away, sir.

1091
01:42:33,105 --> 01:42:35,983
He's stable,
but I don't want to move him yet.

1092
01:42:36,567 --> 01:42:39,612
Grazie. I can never repay you.

1093
01:42:41,197 --> 01:42:42,448
He isn't out of the woods.

1094
01:42:43,157 --> 01:42:44,617
Come on, we have to let him rest.

1095
01:43:04,720 --> 01:43:05,721
You shouldn't be here.

1096
01:43:07,348 --> 01:43:08,348
It's okay.

1097
01:43:09,016 --> 01:43:10,351
Do you know who my father is?

1098
01:43:11,977 --> 01:43:12,977
The Roman?

1099
01:43:15,272 --> 01:43:16,649
Smart kid.

1100
01:43:17,149 --> 01:43:18,734
So you know who I'm going to be?

1101
01:43:20,319 --> 01:43:21,319
The Roman.

1102
01:43:23,406 --> 01:43:24,615
Very smart.

1103
01:43:27,493 --> 01:43:28,828
You remind me of my boy.

1104
01:43:30,037 --> 01:43:31,414
Your pop saved my life.

1105
01:43:33,416 --> 01:43:34,709
I guess that makes us family.

1106
01:43:37,753 --> 01:43:38,879
It fell out of your pocket.

1107
01:43:39,547 --> 01:43:41,048
My insurance policy.

1108
01:43:41,590 --> 01:43:43,300
There's a lot of bad people out there.

1109
01:43:44,135 --> 01:43:45,344
Criminals.

1110
01:43:45,761 --> 01:43:48,597
And everybody knows criminals
are superstitious.

1111
01:43:50,141 --> 01:43:53,394
Sometimes all it takes
to get out of a bad situation

1112
01:43:53,477 --> 01:43:55,062
is a good flip of the coin.

1113
01:43:55,771 --> 01:43:57,273
It didn't work for you tonight?

1114
01:43:58,858 --> 01:44:00,985
Yeah.

1115
01:44:01,527 --> 01:44:04,488
Still, two heads are better than one.

1116
01:44:09,326 --> 01:44:10,536
Keep it, kid.

1117
01:44:11,454 --> 01:44:13,914
All we get is all we take.

1118
01:44:18,335 --> 01:44:21,172
I was eight when Dr. Thomas Wayne
pulled Luigi maroni's bullets

1119
01:44:21,255 --> 01:44:22,506
out of Falcone's chest.

1120
01:44:24,800 --> 01:44:28,596
My father was dead
by a mobster's hand within a year.

1121
01:44:30,097 --> 01:44:33,184
Any connection between my family
and the Roman died then, too.

1122
01:44:35,019 --> 01:44:38,063
Thank you for stopping by.
If there's nothing else...

1123
01:44:41,275 --> 01:44:45,029
Gentlemen, these are the names
and addresses for those who can account

1124
01:44:45,112 --> 01:44:47,490
for master Wayne's whereabouts
on the night in question.

1125
01:44:49,033 --> 01:44:52,203
A lot of names on here.
Must have been quite a night.

1126
01:44:53,162 --> 01:44:56,290
Yes, well, a man was murdered.

1127
01:44:57,416 --> 01:45:00,503
Let us hope your respective offices
can deliver for him

1128
01:45:00,753 --> 01:45:03,798
the justice still denied
Thomas and Martha Wayne.

1129
01:45:05,549 --> 01:45:07,259
What happened to them was a tragedy.

1130
01:45:07,885 --> 01:45:11,222
And all the more reason why your boss
should stay away from men like Falcone.

1131
01:45:12,598 --> 01:45:14,934
Will there ever be a time
when the sins of fathers

1132
01:45:15,017 --> 01:45:17,144
don't fall to their sons for redemption?

1133
01:45:18,354 --> 01:45:19,396
Good day.

1134
01:45:24,652 --> 01:45:27,029
They're going to be watching
my every move today

1135
01:45:27,112 --> 01:45:28,656
to confirm that I'm not the killer.

1136
01:45:29,406 --> 01:45:30,825
Then you'll be staying in?

1137
01:45:32,618 --> 01:45:35,120
No, just pay off some more alibis.

1138
01:45:37,456 --> 01:45:38,624
I have to go to work.

1139
01:45:52,596 --> 01:45:53,639
Sit tight.

1140
01:45:54,390 --> 01:45:56,016
If he knew about us, it would kill him.

1141
01:45:57,685 --> 01:45:58,894
I'll be right here, love.

1142
01:46:12,867 --> 01:46:14,326
Your favorite cannolis.

1143
01:46:14,493 --> 01:46:18,247
Cannoli. Cannolo for one,
cannoli for a box.

1144
01:46:18,622 --> 01:46:20,416
Your Italian is sterco.

1145
01:46:20,708 --> 01:46:22,501
I know, papa. I'm sorry.

1146
01:46:23,586 --> 01:46:26,255
You bring cannoli on father's day,
I forgive.

1147
01:46:26,380 --> 01:46:27,506
Sit.

1148
01:46:32,720 --> 01:46:35,598
This war with Falcone,
it's killing us, pop.

1149
01:46:35,890 --> 01:46:38,893
Carmine thinks we've got
something to do with this holiday jerk.

1150
01:46:39,101 --> 01:46:40,436
Sciocchezze.

1151
01:46:40,561 --> 01:46:43,689
Carmine's paranoia
is not to do with holiday

1152
01:46:43,772 --> 01:46:45,316
but with the new da.

1153
01:46:45,691 --> 01:46:48,527
Unless these two are one and the same.

1154
01:46:51,071 --> 01:46:52,114
Dent's a crusader

1155
01:46:52,197 --> 01:46:54,241
but I can't see him
getting his hands dirty.

1156
01:46:55,492 --> 01:46:56,744
More likely the bat.

1157
01:46:58,037 --> 01:46:59,496
You want advice?

1158
01:46:59,580 --> 01:47:04,960
Win or lose,
the only thing that ends war is peace.

1159
01:47:05,461 --> 01:47:07,880
Make peace with carmine?

1160
01:47:11,050 --> 01:47:12,092
Papa_.

1161
01:47:12,676 --> 01:47:13,761
I don't know.

1162
01:47:13,886 --> 01:47:15,012
I don't...

1163
01:47:18,390 --> 01:47:19,433
Papa!

1164
01:47:22,978 --> 01:47:24,063
Papa!

1165
01:47:48,128 --> 01:47:49,296
Sal!

1166
01:47:50,297 --> 01:47:51,382
I heard a gunshot.

1167
01:47:52,216 --> 01:47:53,258
Are you okay?

1168
01:47:54,343 --> 01:47:55,386
What happened?

1169
01:49:02,411 --> 01:49:04,413
Strange place to do business.

1170
01:49:04,663 --> 01:49:07,875
Guessing it's the last spot
the pigs leave you alone these days.

1171
01:49:47,122 --> 01:49:48,373
Working late?

1172
01:49:49,291 --> 01:49:51,001
How the hell did you get
through security?

1173
01:49:57,049 --> 01:49:58,300
You were with him, right?

1174
01:49:58,759 --> 01:50:01,678
I needed to put an end
to the stupid war with the falcones.

1175
01:50:02,554 --> 01:50:07,017
My father's last words to me were
that I should make peace with my enemy.

1176
01:50:09,812 --> 01:50:11,688
At first I thought he meant carmine...

1177
01:50:12,606 --> 01:50:15,776
But Luigi maroni
would have never wanted that.

1178
01:50:17,778 --> 01:50:21,073
There's only one other thing
he could have meant, so...

1179
01:50:28,539 --> 01:50:31,583
I'm here to make peace with the law.
Cut a deal.

1180
01:50:32,501 --> 01:50:34,753
You want Falcone
and I got plenty on him.

1181
01:50:36,922 --> 01:50:38,382
Enough to put him away for good.

1182
01:50:44,596 --> 01:50:46,265
In exchange for...

1183
01:50:46,473 --> 01:50:49,351
Dropping all outstanding warrants
against me and my men.

1184
01:50:51,770 --> 01:50:52,896
You want Falcone?

1185
01:50:54,398 --> 01:50:56,900
That's the deal. Take it or leave it.

1186
01:50:59,444 --> 01:51:02,447
Tell you what, heads, I'll take it.

1187
01:51:32,686 --> 01:51:35,063
I expected a low turnout
after the new year's fiasco.

1188
01:51:35,147 --> 01:51:38,192
- But this is really pathetic.
- Fine by me.

1189
01:51:39,026 --> 01:51:41,320
The more people stay home,
the easier my job gets.

1190
01:51:41,820 --> 01:51:44,948
Speaking of jobs getting easier,
is it true you got maroni?

1191
01:51:45,449 --> 01:51:46,825
It's not a done deal.

1192
01:51:47,367 --> 01:51:49,286
My office is working out
the details now.

1193
01:51:49,536 --> 01:51:51,830
But if old sal tells a judge
what he's told me...

1194
01:51:52,289 --> 01:51:54,129
Let's just say today's a good day
for the Roman

1195
01:51:54,166 --> 01:51:56,543
to celebrate what's left of his freedom.

1196
01:51:58,837 --> 01:52:00,214
Speak of the devil.

1197
01:52:11,058 --> 01:52:13,602
I'm surprised to find you outdoors
on a holiday.

1198
01:52:14,102 --> 01:52:16,480
Dent -Falcone.

1199
01:52:16,563 --> 01:52:19,816
Actually, I was speaking to your wife...
Mrs. Dent.

1200
01:52:19,900 --> 01:52:20,901
Don't touch her.

1201
01:52:22,861 --> 01:52:25,072
I never took you for a patriot, carmine.

1202
01:52:26,657 --> 01:52:29,493
I wouldn't miss fireworks like this
for all the world.

1203
01:52:31,328 --> 01:52:33,580
Good evening, Mrs. Dent, captain.

1204
01:52:34,373 --> 01:52:35,457
Evening.

1205
01:52:44,716 --> 01:52:47,219
I tell you, harv, if I could,

1206
01:52:47,302 --> 01:52:49,388
I'd have every cop in the city
here tonight.

1207
01:53:30,178 --> 01:53:32,472
See you on the other side.

1208
01:54:15,724 --> 01:54:19,895
Utter inanity
proved his insanity

1209
01:54:20,437 --> 01:54:23,648
while he rattled a couple of bones.

1210
01:54:38,205 --> 01:54:41,041
I've been thinking about it
and maybe you're right.

1211
01:54:42,209 --> 01:54:44,252
Uh, about what?

1212
01:54:50,133 --> 01:54:51,301
Having kids.

1213
01:55:01,103 --> 01:55:02,270
Stay down.

1214
01:55:06,650 --> 01:55:08,568
Get to Gordon. I'll be back.

1215
01:55:08,860 --> 01:55:11,613
Harvey, no. Harvey!

1216
01:55:32,384 --> 01:55:33,593
Get out of here.

1217
01:55:33,802 --> 01:55:36,430
Not till I know
why this scumbag is trying to kill me.

1218
01:55:37,305 --> 01:55:41,101
If I was trying to kill you,
you'd be dead already.

1219
01:55:42,561 --> 01:55:44,604
Then what are you...

1220
01:55:53,572 --> 01:55:54,739
That's enough.

1221
01:55:59,244 --> 01:56:00,996
Someone's trying to provoke you, dent.

1222
01:56:01,371 --> 01:56:02,664
Into doing what?

1223
01:56:04,291 --> 01:56:05,834
Good question...

1224
01:57:14,569 --> 01:57:15,862
Get up.

1225
01:57:17,614 --> 01:57:19,950
"The walrus and the carpenter

1226
01:57:20,033 --> 01:57:22,202
were walking close at hand.

1227
01:57:22,619 --> 01:57:27,582
They wept like anything
to see such quantities of sand.

1228
01:57:28,583 --> 01:57:32,963
'If seven maids with seven mops
swept it for half a year,

1229
01:57:33,046 --> 01:57:37,968
do you suppose, ' the walrus said,
'that they could get it clear?"'

1230
01:57:38,385 --> 01:57:41,680
I doubt it.

1231
01:57:48,103 --> 01:57:49,145
There.

1232
01:57:50,689 --> 01:57:52,524
That's the drop.

1233
01:57:55,944 --> 01:57:58,071
As for the bat,

1234
01:57:58,655 --> 01:58:01,533
delivering him wasn't part of the deal.

1235
01:58:01,616 --> 01:58:05,829
So we can do
whatever we want with him.

1236
01:58:06,204 --> 01:58:09,916
What fun.

1237
01:58:16,798 --> 01:58:19,509
Twinkle, twinkle little bat.

1238
01:58:21,720 --> 01:58:24,639
How I wonder what you're...

1239
01:58:25,974 --> 01:58:29,978
Your business with the Roman
ends tonight.

1240
01:58:32,606 --> 01:58:34,482
No.

1241
01:58:41,031 --> 01:58:42,741
Poor little thing.

1242
01:58:42,824 --> 01:58:45,577
Such a tiny little thing.

1243
01:59:14,856 --> 01:59:15,982
No.

1244
01:59:22,530 --> 01:59:24,258
- Down here.
- What do you got?

1245
01:59:24,282 --> 01:59:25,533
Run!

1246
01:59:32,165 --> 01:59:34,000
Motive means opportunity.

1247
01:59:34,459 --> 01:59:36,211
Dent. All right, let me be clear.

1248
01:59:36,294 --> 01:59:39,506
This freak is done terrorizing
my family. Done!

1249
01:59:39,631 --> 01:59:42,759
You expect us to believe
that a respected public servant...

1250
01:59:42,842 --> 01:59:44,678
I don't know why you watch that garbage.

1251
01:59:44,761 --> 01:59:45,762
Is it true?

1252
01:59:46,388 --> 01:59:49,182
You believe this bs?
Is that why you want a divorce?

1253
01:59:49,599 --> 01:59:50,642
I never said that.

1254
01:59:51,017 --> 01:59:52,477
I have been talking about therapy.

1255
01:59:52,644 --> 01:59:56,314
Maybe divorce isn't so bad,
now that you can't go back to him.

1256
01:59:57,107 --> 01:59:58,942
Ungrateful bitch.

1257
02:00:03,238 --> 02:00:06,157
I'm sorry. I don't know why I said that.

1258
02:00:08,993 --> 02:00:10,286
I'm going to be late for court.

1259
02:00:13,957 --> 02:00:15,625
You left the basement door open again.

1260
02:00:16,835 --> 02:00:18,712
I haven't been in the basement today.

1261
02:01:02,756 --> 02:01:03,757
Mr. Dent?

1262
02:01:07,051 --> 02:01:09,429
Mr. Dent, are you ready to proceed?

1263
02:01:10,889 --> 02:01:13,183
Uh, yes.
Yes, your honor. Thank you.

1264
02:01:13,308 --> 02:01:14,893
Murderer.

1265
02:01:14,976 --> 02:01:16,102
What?

1266
02:01:19,731 --> 02:01:22,400
I asked if you're ready, Mr. Dent.

1267
02:01:23,359 --> 02:01:25,862
Yes, of course.

1268
02:01:27,530 --> 02:01:31,242
Mr. Maroni, you have confessed
to 19 counts...

1269
02:01:31,367 --> 02:01:32,368
Confess.

1270
02:01:38,458 --> 02:01:39,459
What the hell is he...

1271
02:01:39,542 --> 02:01:42,170
He's here, captain. The roof.

1272
02:01:43,046 --> 02:01:46,549
Mr. District attorney,
we are all waiting.

1273
02:01:47,008 --> 02:01:49,594
Uh, yes, yes. Sorry, your honor.

1274
02:01:54,641 --> 02:01:56,226
Rooftop really necessary?

1275
02:01:56,768 --> 02:01:58,353
I thought you'd want privacy.

1276
02:01:58,812 --> 02:02:00,480
Harvey's starting to lose it down there.

1277
02:02:00,939 --> 02:02:03,942
I think all this holiday speculation
in the press is finally getting to...

1278
02:02:04,984 --> 02:02:06,152
Privacy?

1279
02:02:11,449 --> 02:02:12,575
Where'd you find them?

1280
02:02:13,701 --> 02:02:14,994
You're not going to like it.

1281
02:02:17,247 --> 02:02:20,667
Uh, yeah. I hit Frankie gazzo
and his brother Lenny.

1282
02:02:20,750 --> 02:02:22,544
Tossed their bodies in the Gotham river.

1283
02:02:23,336 --> 02:02:25,672
Lots of wise guys you're looking for
are in there.

1284
02:02:26,256 --> 02:02:29,634
Maybe that's why I got an ulcer.
You know, from drinking the water.

1285
02:02:34,639 --> 02:02:36,808
And didn't you commit
these murders and felonies

1286
02:02:36,891 --> 02:02:41,020
under direct orders from
carmine "the Roman" Falcone?

1287
02:02:43,815 --> 02:02:46,693
Felonies? Nah, guy's a Saint.

1288
02:03:10,675 --> 02:03:12,051
- Now.
- Now.

1289
02:03:14,679 --> 02:03:15,847
You okay, dent?

1290
02:03:17,098 --> 02:03:18,308
What is it, heartburn?

1291
02:03:19,183 --> 02:03:20,560
Happy to share.

1292
02:03:22,020 --> 02:03:24,772
Now, Mr. Maroni,
may I remind you that your immunity

1293
02:03:24,856 --> 02:03:28,359
is contingent upon your truthful
testimony during these proceedings.

1294
02:03:28,651 --> 02:03:32,030
And I told you the truth.
Falcone is clean as a whistle.

1295
02:03:36,534 --> 02:03:38,328
Sal, what are you doing?

1296
02:03:38,703 --> 02:03:39,829
What I'm told.

1297
02:03:41,831 --> 02:03:42,874
Okay.

1298
02:03:43,416 --> 02:03:45,960
Um, your honor,
in light of the witness's...

1299
02:03:46,044 --> 02:03:47,187
Double cross!

1300
02:03:47,211 --> 02:03:50,632
Change of heart,
I need to request a continuance.

1301
02:03:51,007 --> 02:03:54,636
Continuance? Uh, what is that?
Like, uh, a holiday?

1302
02:03:54,761 --> 02:03:56,304
- What?
- Holiday.

1303
02:03:56,429 --> 02:03:58,431
You know, like father's day.

1304
02:04:01,142 --> 02:04:03,186
Luigi maroni sends his regards.

1305
02:04:03,519 --> 02:04:04,646
Go.

1306
02:04:10,818 --> 02:04:12,612
Bailiff, detain the witness!

1307
02:04:13,363 --> 02:04:15,031
You're dead, holiday!

1308
02:04:15,114 --> 02:04:18,826
You hear me, dent?
That stuff will eat through concrete!

1309
02:04:24,207 --> 02:04:25,708
- Harvey!
- My god.

1310
02:04:25,792 --> 02:04:26,960
Call an ambulance!

1311
02:04:50,525 --> 02:04:51,859
Idiots.

1312
02:04:51,943 --> 02:04:53,486
They think it's you.

1313
02:04:54,070 --> 02:04:56,322
Who are you?

1314
02:04:58,199 --> 02:04:59,993
You know who I am.

1315
02:05:02,161 --> 02:05:03,579
No, I...

1316
02:05:03,746 --> 02:05:05,373
You sound tired.

1317
02:05:06,165 --> 02:05:07,959
Why not let me take the wheel?

1318
02:05:09,085 --> 02:05:12,171
I don't know what's happening.

1319
02:05:13,631 --> 02:05:15,883
I'm sorry no one told you, harv.

1320
02:05:16,426 --> 02:05:17,844
Told me what?

1321
02:05:18,803 --> 02:05:20,138
You're dead.

1322
02:05:27,353 --> 02:05:28,771
I have to take this.

1323
02:05:32,233 --> 02:05:33,443
Yeah.

1324
02:05:35,778 --> 02:05:36,821
Now?

1325
02:05:37,739 --> 02:05:39,824
No, it's the perfect time.

1326
02:05:41,909 --> 02:05:45,413
The doctor says he'll be fine
in a few days. Don't worry.

1327
02:05:46,122 --> 02:05:47,331
Oh, my god!

1328
02:05:47,790 --> 02:05:48,875
He's gone.

1329
02:05:50,168 --> 02:05:52,587
Secure the exits.
He couldn't have gotten far. Let's go!

1330
02:06:15,818 --> 02:06:18,488
Well, where is...

1331
02:06:20,907 --> 02:06:23,451
Let me guess.
You're not coming after all.

1332
02:06:23,785 --> 02:06:25,119
Afraid not.

1333
02:06:25,203 --> 02:06:28,998
Yeah. You're not really one
to get your hands dirty.

1334
02:06:29,165 --> 02:06:30,605
You know nothing about me.

1335
02:06:30,708 --> 02:06:35,171
I know you're a liar,
a thief, a murderer.

1336
02:06:35,755 --> 02:06:36,964
A father.

1337
02:06:41,260 --> 02:06:43,471
- A coward.
- Goodbye, dent.

1338
02:06:47,809 --> 02:06:48,893
Fine.

1339
02:06:49,852 --> 02:06:51,437
He wants to talk to you.

1340
02:07:28,933 --> 02:07:29,934
Come on.

1341
02:07:30,309 --> 02:07:31,435
Come on!

1342
02:07:38,151 --> 02:07:39,735
Really?

1343
02:07:53,541 --> 02:07:56,502
It's not personal.
It's business.

1344
02:08:15,021 --> 02:08:17,181
Happy birthday, papa!

1345
02:08:19,442 --> 02:08:21,569
All right, here we go.

1346
02:08:26,157 --> 02:08:28,659
What a wonderful night. Thank you.

1347
02:08:29,785 --> 02:08:31,621
This year has been a trying one.

1348
02:08:32,580 --> 02:08:34,790
And while we have yet to fully dismantle

1349
02:08:34,874 --> 02:08:37,627
the vicious machine
the law has set against us,

1350
02:08:38,628 --> 02:08:41,339
you might say we put a dent in it.

1351
02:08:48,221 --> 02:08:52,183
To Sofia Falcone,
for brokering the peace with maroni.

1352
02:08:52,934 --> 02:08:53,935
Mille grazie.

1353
02:08:57,063 --> 02:08:58,731
And my beautiful sister, Carla.

1354
02:08:59,315 --> 02:09:00,316
Where is she?

1355
02:09:00,775 --> 02:09:01,817
Cana?

1356
02:09:06,364 --> 02:09:07,990
Probably more TV interviews.

1357
02:09:11,619 --> 02:09:14,080
Now, now. Those interviews helped.

1358
02:09:14,747 --> 02:09:16,082
I think she's got a future.

1359
02:09:44,360 --> 02:09:46,904
{933931 -sorry to startle you.

1360
02:09:49,448 --> 02:09:51,033
Shouldn't you be looking for Harvey?

1361
02:09:52,451 --> 02:09:56,080
I'm narrowing down his location
by interviewing known associates.

1362
02:09:58,874 --> 02:10:01,252
Known associ... oh...

1363
02:10:02,586 --> 02:10:04,130
Well, you're wasting your time.

1364
02:10:04,714 --> 02:10:07,717
The man's a mystery.
Or so it would seem.

1365
02:10:09,260 --> 02:10:11,721
Did you notice any recent changes
in his behavior?

1366
02:10:12,096 --> 02:10:13,347
Mood swings?

1367
02:10:14,557 --> 02:10:16,350
Is that so strange
when you deal with people

1368
02:10:16,434 --> 02:10:17,852
like Falcone every day?

1369
02:10:20,730 --> 02:10:22,898
Harvey never mentioned
he went to Oxford.

1370
02:10:27,486 --> 02:10:28,696
Is it important?

1371
02:10:29,947 --> 02:10:30,947
Maybe.

1372
02:10:33,200 --> 02:10:35,411
This doesn't feel like
just a job for you.

1373
02:10:36,162 --> 02:10:38,289
It's personal. Why?

1374
02:10:40,499 --> 02:10:43,169
He's my friend, and he needs help.

1375
02:11:05,733 --> 02:11:07,193
Dinner time already?

1376
02:11:11,655 --> 02:11:13,991
"Solomon grundy,

1377
02:11:14,658 --> 02:11:17,328
born on a Monday..."

1378
02:11:18,371 --> 02:11:22,083
"Christened on a Tuesday,
married on a Wednesday,

1379
02:11:22,708 --> 02:11:27,338
ill on Thursday, worse on Friday,

1380
02:11:28,339 --> 02:11:30,383
died on Saturday."

1381
02:11:30,466 --> 02:11:31,967
"Buried on Sunday."

1382
02:11:33,928 --> 02:11:35,596
That was the end.

1383
02:11:38,432 --> 02:11:40,893
"Born on a Monday."

1384
02:11:48,234 --> 02:11:51,237
Reborn, resurrected.

1385
02:11:52,655 --> 02:11:54,448
On a Monday.

1386
02:11:55,699 --> 02:11:57,326
Is that what happened to you?

1387
02:11:58,202 --> 02:11:59,995
Did you die and come back?

1388
02:12:04,458 --> 02:12:07,420
Can a man live two lives?

1389
02:12:07,503 --> 02:12:11,257
Born on a Monday.

1390
02:12:15,886 --> 02:12:18,431
Born on a Monday.

1391
02:12:24,979 --> 02:12:27,523
Thirty days hath September.

1392
02:12:28,274 --> 02:12:31,527
But today's the one
that troubles you the most.

1393
02:12:32,319 --> 02:12:33,529
Where is he?

1394
02:12:34,238 --> 02:12:35,531
It's been months.

1395
02:12:38,075 --> 02:12:39,493
I've missed you.

1396
02:12:39,577 --> 02:12:43,038
The da who was attacked and maimed
before vanishing from the hospital.

1397
02:12:44,582 --> 02:12:45,582
Hmm, he does that.

1398
02:12:45,624 --> 02:12:47,501
Later that night, Carla viti,

1399
02:12:47,585 --> 02:12:50,004
who'd publicly accused dent
of being holiday,

1400
02:12:50,087 --> 02:12:52,590
was killed on her way
to her brother's birthday party.

1401
02:12:53,466 --> 02:12:56,343
I know. Wasn't that terrible?

1402
02:12:56,927 --> 02:12:58,387
I think she was right.

1403
02:12:59,054 --> 02:13:00,473
Of course you do.

1404
02:13:01,515 --> 02:13:05,311
It seems everyone who comes after dent
winds up dead.

1405
02:13:05,644 --> 02:13:08,814
We need to find Harvey
before he kills again.

1406
02:13:09,690 --> 02:13:11,025
What do you know?

1407
02:13:12,067 --> 02:13:17,281
Gordon and his men have been here
day after day asking the same thing.

1408
02:13:18,199 --> 02:13:20,367
I'll tell you what I told the captain.

1409
02:13:21,243 --> 02:13:25,247
Let me walk out of here
and I'll stop the killing.

1410
02:13:27,166 --> 02:13:28,292
We're done.

1411
02:13:32,421 --> 02:13:34,507
It's labor day.

1412
02:13:35,424 --> 02:13:38,761
And, if the pattern holds,

1413
02:13:38,844 --> 02:13:43,390
I believe you have something
holiday wants.

1414
02:13:46,852 --> 02:13:48,052
Head north on at well.

1415
02:13:48,562 --> 02:13:51,023
- Sir, the penitentiary is south...
- I know where it is.

1416
02:13:51,899 --> 02:13:54,735
This is the longest goddamn
prisoner transfer I've ever seen.

1417
02:13:56,737 --> 02:13:58,864
Guess you guys
just can't get enough of me.

1418
02:14:46,996 --> 02:14:47,997
Dent!

1419
02:14:48,664 --> 02:14:49,832
You're alive?

1420
02:14:50,416 --> 02:14:52,793
He's no longer running this operation.

1421
02:14:53,669 --> 02:14:55,337
All right.

1422
02:14:56,714 --> 02:14:57,881
That's enough.

1423
02:14:58,215 --> 02:15:01,260
Relax, Jim, I'm not here to kill maroni.

1424
02:15:02,219 --> 02:15:06,765
I'm here to thank him
for giving me a new... outlook.

1425
02:15:07,975 --> 02:15:09,226
Oh, my god.

1426
02:15:09,852 --> 02:15:11,061
Harvey...

1427
02:15:11,687 --> 02:15:15,983
I have to tell you, jimbo,
your gun has come in handy.

1428
02:15:17,234 --> 02:15:21,905
I know it was meant for Harvey,
but possession is nine-tenths.

1429
02:15:24,783 --> 02:15:26,577
If you're not Harvey, then, who are you?

1430
02:15:27,369 --> 02:15:28,495
Holiday?

1431
02:15:29,246 --> 02:15:30,914
We found the guns in your basement.

1432
02:15:32,333 --> 02:15:35,044
You found the guns in my basement?

1433
02:15:37,421 --> 02:15:38,714
Of course.

1434
02:15:39,923 --> 02:15:41,216
We know everything.

1435
02:15:41,967 --> 02:15:43,367
We just wanna take you to get help.

1436
02:15:43,427 --> 02:15:45,638
I think Thomas Wayne was onto something.

1437
02:15:46,639 --> 02:15:49,141
You can't beat 'em, jimbo, not your way.

1438
02:15:50,059 --> 02:15:51,268
Join 'em first.

1439
02:15:53,062 --> 02:15:55,230
Then beat 'em on their own terms.

1440
02:15:56,273 --> 02:15:58,567
Heads, you die.

1441
02:16:07,868 --> 02:16:09,668
It is up to you, Harvey.

1442
02:16:10,371 --> 02:16:12,873
You and I know
that both sides of that coin are heads.

1443
02:16:13,874 --> 02:16:15,376
How the hell could you...

1444
02:16:17,544 --> 02:16:20,506
Oh, nice outfit, bats.

1445
02:16:21,048 --> 02:16:23,425
I suppose this little trap
was your idea.

1446
02:16:23,842 --> 02:16:26,178
Drop the gun, now!

1447
02:16:33,185 --> 02:16:34,228
[Gunshofl

1448
02:16:56,333 --> 02:16:58,669
Come on, grundy, move your ass.

1449
02:17:12,433 --> 02:17:15,018
I think we're back
to square one.

1450
02:17:37,291 --> 02:17:38,792
Ah, you're up early.

1451
02:17:40,794 --> 02:17:43,088
Oh, no, I just got in.

1452
02:17:44,631 --> 02:17:47,551
Of course.
Then I suppose it's off to bed with you.

1453
02:17:50,763 --> 02:17:53,243
- Is there something I can help...
- How did it happen, Alfred?

1454
02:17:57,352 --> 02:17:59,772
Were they forced into business
with the falcones?

1455
02:18:01,648 --> 02:18:05,319
Or were they so set on building a legacy
that they'd work with the devil himself?

1456
02:18:11,450 --> 02:18:15,120
Your parents believed that there are
two ways to look at everything...

1457
02:18:18,040 --> 02:18:19,166
And everyone.

1458
02:18:21,627 --> 02:18:22,711
Only two?

1459
02:18:23,170 --> 02:18:24,046
They were young.

1460
02:18:24,129 --> 02:18:28,675
Two exceptionally good people
living in an exceptionally bad place,

1461
02:18:28,801 --> 02:18:29,927
trying to make it better.

1462
02:18:30,928 --> 02:18:32,137
But Falcone?

1463
02:18:32,805 --> 02:18:34,556
Didn't they know that by
legitimizing him,

1464
02:18:34,640 --> 02:18:36,475
they were helping to make a monster?

1465
02:18:36,558 --> 02:18:39,770
They made difficult choices
and more than a few mistakes.

1466
02:18:41,271 --> 02:18:43,273
But they were willing to pay for them.

1467
02:18:45,609 --> 02:18:49,154
I've always told myself
that I'm doing what I do to honor them.

1468
02:18:49,947 --> 02:18:54,409
What does it mean if deep down,
I'm really doing it to redeem them?

1469
02:18:57,246 --> 02:18:59,456
I think it means
your parents would be proud...

1470
02:19:01,583 --> 02:19:03,335
Of their real legacy.

1471
02:19:13,095 --> 02:19:14,137
This is absurd.

1472
02:19:15,764 --> 02:19:19,142
Sorry for the inconvenience, ma'am,
but it's Halloween.

1473
02:19:19,226 --> 02:19:20,644
Mr. Dent is still at large.

1474
02:19:20,727 --> 02:19:22,604
And captain Gordon ordered us
to be here.

1475
02:19:23,272 --> 02:19:24,773
So you're stuck with us.

1476
02:19:25,858 --> 02:19:27,734
You've blocked in my car.

1477
02:19:28,569 --> 02:19:31,530
We're more than happy
to drive you anywhere you need to go.

1478
02:19:31,613 --> 02:19:34,408
Though you'll be making our jobs
a lot easier if you remain indoors.

1479
02:19:34,700 --> 02:19:37,327
There's no way to know
where or when your husband will show up.

1480
02:19:38,287 --> 02:19:39,746
My husband is dead.

1481
02:19:43,125 --> 02:19:45,669
I'm sorry, ma'am, but that's not true.

1482
02:19:47,504 --> 02:19:48,589
Yes, it is.

1483
02:20:07,774 --> 02:20:09,109
Wake up, Julian.

1484
02:20:10,110 --> 02:20:11,612
You know what today is.

1485
02:20:15,782 --> 02:20:17,826
It's all hallows' Eve...

1486
02:20:18,994 --> 02:20:22,039
The 31st day of the tenth month...

1487
02:20:23,165 --> 02:20:28,921
And the 305th of this
miserable leap year.

1488
02:20:30,881 --> 02:20:32,007
And?

1489
02:20:35,844 --> 02:20:37,846
Taco Tuesday.

1490
02:20:38,639 --> 02:20:40,098
Muy bueno.

1491
02:20:40,265 --> 02:20:42,517
What the hell?

1492
02:21:05,791 --> 02:21:08,460
Trick or treat.

1493
02:21:10,921 --> 02:21:13,423
Attacking us like that
out in the open...

1494
02:21:15,258 --> 02:21:16,718
It didn't fit the profile.

1495
02:21:17,970 --> 02:21:19,638
So it was a hired gun.

1496
02:21:19,721 --> 02:21:23,016
We see dent and holiday
in the same place at the same time,

1497
02:21:23,100 --> 02:21:26,061
and, just like that,
the da's got himself an alibi.

1498
02:21:28,730 --> 02:21:30,190
Did Harvey study at Oxford?

1499
02:21:30,273 --> 02:21:31,483
Like Falcone's boy?

1500
02:21:32,025 --> 02:21:35,237
I see where you're going
but don't let Harvey hear you say it.

1501
02:21:35,737 --> 02:21:36,947
He's a Gotham u man.

1502
02:21:37,447 --> 02:21:38,865
A dyed-in-the-wool nighthawk.

1503
02:21:39,700 --> 02:21:41,034
Don't get hung up on it.

1504
02:21:43,495 --> 02:21:44,997
Not every lead checks out.

1505
02:21:46,123 --> 02:21:48,542
And we already have
what we need to make our case.

1506
02:21:49,543 --> 02:21:51,586
It's hard to believe
the man who stood on this roof

1507
02:21:51,670 --> 02:21:55,173
and made that promise,
that bond with each of us,

1508
02:21:55,257 --> 02:21:56,550
would cross the line.

1509
02:21:56,842 --> 02:21:58,885
Can you honestly say that man

1510
02:21:58,969 --> 02:22:00,887
and the one we met in the alley
were the same?

1511
02:22:01,513 --> 02:22:02,806
There are deep scars there...

1512
02:22:04,016 --> 02:22:05,767
And I'm not talking about his face.

1513
02:22:06,685 --> 02:22:09,021
If you think we're wrong,
find the evidence.

1514
02:22:09,563 --> 02:22:12,399
But, for now,
the best way to save lives,

1515
02:22:12,899 --> 02:22:15,318
including Harvey's, is to bring him in.

1516
02:22:40,427 --> 02:22:42,637
Do you know what my people
call this past year?

1517
02:22:44,681 --> 02:22:46,099
The long Halloween.

1518
02:22:46,892 --> 02:22:48,143
My nephew,

1519
02:22:49,102 --> 02:22:51,855
my son, my sister,

1520
02:22:52,814 --> 02:22:54,191
half my men.

1521
02:22:59,279 --> 02:23:01,364
Why would dent kill your son?

1522
02:23:05,535 --> 02:23:08,622
I wish I had the chance
to be a better father to my boy.

1523
02:23:10,040 --> 02:23:11,583
We will never see each other again.

1524
02:23:13,960 --> 02:23:15,087
For that...

1525
02:23:15,796 --> 02:23:16,963
I am so...

1526
02:23:19,382 --> 02:23:20,425
So sorry.

1527
02:23:26,556 --> 02:23:28,892
There is a rule among my kind.

1528
02:23:29,643 --> 02:23:31,394
We leave the wives out of it.

1529
02:23:32,729 --> 02:23:35,941
But dent does not play by our rules.

1530
02:23:38,360 --> 02:23:41,196
And when that happens, people die.

1531
02:23:42,280 --> 02:23:43,323
Whose wives?

1532
02:23:46,493 --> 02:23:48,286
I guess justice really is blind.

1533
02:24:00,173 --> 02:24:01,216
Papa.

1534
02:24:01,299 --> 02:24:04,469
Everything is fine, Sofia.
I just... stumbled.

1535
02:24:14,354 --> 02:24:15,981
That wasn't necessary.

1536
02:24:16,356 --> 02:24:17,566
Maybe not.

1537
02:24:18,483 --> 02:24:20,902
Are you going to tell me
why you're so obsessed with them?

1538
02:24:35,167 --> 02:24:39,004
I never thanked you for finding me
and getting me home that night.

1539
02:24:40,714 --> 02:24:42,424
You thought I was your mother.

1540
02:24:42,507 --> 02:24:44,009
Scarecrow's fear toxin.

1541
02:24:47,470 --> 02:24:50,599
Where you found me is where I lost her.

1542
02:24:56,271 --> 02:24:58,064
I don't even know my mother's name.

1543
02:24:59,608 --> 02:25:02,694
But I think there's someone
who can tell me.

1544
02:25:08,283 --> 02:25:09,326
Your father.

1545
02:25:11,494 --> 02:25:12,579
Are you sure?

1546
02:25:13,330 --> 02:25:16,666
When the time comes,
I'm not sure I'll have it in me to ask.

1547
02:25:17,918 --> 02:25:22,047
Is there even such a thing
as a normal family in this city?

1548
02:25:22,797 --> 02:25:23,924
Maybe not...

1549
02:25:24,758 --> 02:25:25,926
For people like us.

1550
02:25:40,357 --> 02:25:41,483
What the hell is that?

1551
02:25:43,193 --> 02:25:45,028
Oh, shit!

1552
02:25:47,781 --> 02:25:50,825
All units,
10-33 at the corner of 6th and Mason.

1553
02:25:50,909 --> 02:25:52,829
All available units respond.

1554
02:25:57,082 --> 02:26:00,168
No, captain said we don't leave
for anything, not tonight.

1555
02:26:33,702 --> 02:26:36,663
Pop goes the weasel

1556
02:26:42,043 --> 02:26:43,128
Keep coming, boys.

1557
02:26:43,795 --> 02:26:46,131
Everyone's invited to this party.

1558
02:26:47,007 --> 02:26:49,175
Not everyone.

1559
02:26:57,350 --> 02:26:58,518
Heads.

1560
02:26:59,102 --> 02:27:01,396
I meant heads!

1561
02:27:05,483 --> 02:27:07,652
Sofia, please. It was nothing.

1562
02:27:08,528 --> 02:27:10,280
Stop treating me like an old man.

1563
02:27:10,989 --> 02:27:12,115
You're not old.

1564
02:27:15,702 --> 02:27:17,037
Maybe I am.

1565
02:27:17,787 --> 02:27:19,622
Too old for this business, at least.

1566
02:27:25,837 --> 02:27:28,256
Have you... heard from your mother?

1567
02:27:29,799 --> 02:27:30,842
She loves you.

1568
02:27:31,926 --> 02:27:33,261
Just not this place.

1569
02:27:34,888 --> 02:27:36,139
This place is me.

1570
02:27:38,016 --> 02:27:42,270
I know you think that,
and maybe at one time it was.

1571
02:27:43,521 --> 02:27:44,939
But things have changed,

1572
02:27:45,482 --> 02:27:46,524
so much...

1573
02:27:47,859 --> 02:27:48,985
So fast.

1574
02:27:50,195 --> 02:27:51,404
Haven't I changed with them?

1575
02:27:52,906 --> 02:27:54,491
Yes, you have.

1576
02:27:54,574 --> 02:27:58,370
But when you were coming up,
when mama was here,

1577
02:27:58,453 --> 02:28:01,706
you wouldn't have thought to hire freaks
like poison Ivy and scarecrow.

1578
02:28:02,916 --> 02:28:05,001
These... people,

1579
02:28:06,294 --> 02:28:07,879
they're not stable, papa.

1580
02:28:11,508 --> 02:28:12,592
Times change.

1581
02:28:15,512 --> 02:28:16,679
Boss!

1582
02:28:17,013 --> 02:28:18,556
Something's wrong downstairs.

1583
02:28:18,640 --> 02:28:19,557
The cops took off

1584
02:28:19,641 --> 02:28:21,643
and we can't get any of our guys
on the comm.

1585
02:28:22,143 --> 02:28:23,186
Maron...

1586
02:28:59,305 --> 02:29:00,306
Sofia, no!

1587
02:29:16,573 --> 02:29:18,116
Come on, you mother...

1588
02:29:38,803 --> 02:29:39,888
Sofia!

1589
02:30:22,180 --> 02:30:23,223
What is this?

1590
02:30:28,520 --> 02:30:30,355
Judgment day.

1591
02:30:37,237 --> 02:30:38,717
We lost them in the sewers.

1592
02:30:39,155 --> 02:30:41,199
You're right.
This was meant to distract us.

1593
02:30:42,242 --> 02:30:45,161
Yeah, but distract us from what?

1594
02:30:50,166 --> 02:30:52,418
I really owe it all to you,
carmine.

1595
02:30:53,419 --> 02:30:56,839
You've taught me
that all men are guilty...

1596
02:30:58,675 --> 02:31:00,343
And innocent

1597
02:31:01,553 --> 02:31:05,056
which makes justice nothing more
than the flip of a coin.

1598
02:31:06,849 --> 02:31:08,434
The outcome unpredictable.

1599
02:31:09,060 --> 02:31:10,186
That is, of course...

1600
02:31:11,604 --> 02:31:16,609
Unless the system is corrupted,
rigged in a man's favor.

1601
02:31:17,318 --> 02:31:20,822
Legit businessman/philanthropist by day.

1602
02:31:21,698 --> 02:31:24,951
Criminal racketeer, murderer by night.

1603
02:31:26,202 --> 02:31:28,955
You've rigged every game
you've ever played

1604
02:31:29,038 --> 02:31:31,833
in your business and your family.

1605
02:31:33,710 --> 02:31:36,004
It's really the most minor
of adjustments,

1606
02:31:36,921 --> 02:31:40,466
a small change of outlook
that decides if you live...

1607
02:31:41,593 --> 02:31:42,844
Or not.

1608
02:31:51,227 --> 02:31:53,187
Just pull the fucking trigger.

1609
02:31:55,315 --> 02:31:56,566
You haven't listened.

1610
02:31:56,733 --> 02:32:01,279
If you had, you'd understand
that for the first time, carmine,

1611
02:32:01,571 --> 02:32:03,156
it really isn't up to me.

1612
02:32:03,948 --> 02:32:05,116
Good luck.

1613
02:32:13,541 --> 02:32:14,542
No!

1614
02:33:12,934 --> 02:33:15,728
En garde, you sanctimonious shit...

1615
02:33:32,453 --> 02:33:35,415
Nancy, hold all my calls.

1616
02:33:36,124 --> 02:33:38,751
I have to terminate someone.

1617
02:33:58,396 --> 02:33:59,397
Harvey, don't!

1618
02:34:25,214 --> 02:34:27,633
Alone at last.

1619
02:34:29,302 --> 02:34:31,345
Now let's get you out of all this.

1620
02:34:47,028 --> 02:34:48,154
Stay back.

1621
02:34:58,915 --> 02:34:59,999
Harvey.

1622
02:35:00,333 --> 02:35:01,834
You don't have to do this.

1623
02:35:02,919 --> 02:35:05,004
Harvey, Harvey, Harvey.

1624
02:35:05,880 --> 02:35:08,090
Can't you see I'm a new man, bats?

1625
02:35:08,674 --> 02:35:10,301
I'm finally awake.

1626
02:35:11,427 --> 02:35:12,970
And unlike Harvey dent,

1627
02:35:13,054 --> 02:35:16,432
I'm not beholden
to petty motives like revenge,

1628
02:35:16,641 --> 02:35:19,936
or worse, career advancement.

1629
02:35:20,937 --> 02:35:22,063
A weight has been lifted.

1630
02:35:22,980 --> 02:35:27,193
I don't have to decide who's innocent
and who's guilty anymore.

1631
02:35:27,610 --> 02:35:32,198
All I have to do... is execute.

1632
02:35:37,286 --> 02:35:38,287
- Guilty.
- No!

1633
02:35:38,371 --> 02:35:39,914
No!

1634
02:35:52,802 --> 02:35:53,845
Papa.

1635
02:35:55,429 --> 02:35:56,430
Sofia, no!

1636
02:36:04,522 --> 02:36:05,606
Two bullets only.

1637
02:36:06,315 --> 02:36:07,525
Sorry, gorgeous.

1638
02:36:08,526 --> 02:36:12,488
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1639
02:36:24,292 --> 02:36:25,376
Sofia.

1640
02:36:29,297 --> 02:36:32,174
I can't... I can't hold on.

1641
02:37:10,838 --> 02:37:12,381
Louisa?

1642
02:37:13,674 --> 02:37:14,759
Louisa.

1643
02:37:21,265 --> 02:37:22,265
Selina.

1644
02:37:25,770 --> 02:37:26,771
Sehna?

1645
02:37:27,939 --> 02:37:29,231
Let me help you.

1646
02:37:34,695 --> 02:37:37,615
All we get is all we take.

1647
02:37:39,116 --> 02:37:40,618
Do you still believe?

1648
02:37:41,786 --> 02:37:43,120
Yes.

1649
02:37:43,204 --> 02:37:44,413
I do.

1650
02:37:46,582 --> 02:37:47,667
Good.

1651
02:38:18,698 --> 02:38:20,866
- Harvey?
- Not anymore.

1652
02:38:25,579 --> 02:38:27,123
It had to be done.

1653
02:38:28,666 --> 02:38:30,251
You will never convince me of that.

1654
02:38:31,919 --> 02:38:34,005
There won't be
any judges to be bribed.

1655
02:38:35,047 --> 02:38:36,757
No witnesses to disappear.

1656
02:38:38,134 --> 02:38:41,220
The Roman is dead
and two-face killed him.

1657
02:38:43,431 --> 02:38:45,224
The long Halloween...

1658
02:38:46,392 --> 02:38:47,393
Is over.

1659
02:38:50,813 --> 02:38:51,939
We'll get you help.

1660
02:38:54,650 --> 02:38:58,446
You're the ones
who're gonna need help from now on.

1661
02:39:00,448 --> 02:39:01,532
Harvey...

1662
02:39:02,033 --> 02:39:03,367
Two-face...

1663
02:39:04,452 --> 02:39:05,453
Whatever.

1664
02:39:05,536 --> 02:39:07,580
You betrayed everything you believe in.

1665
02:39:09,373 --> 02:39:10,541
Not everything.

1666
02:39:16,338 --> 02:39:17,715
Arrest me, jimbo.

1667
02:39:19,383 --> 02:39:20,760
I'm responsible.

1668
02:39:21,552 --> 02:39:25,347
Not just for Falcone
but all the holiday killings.

1669
02:39:27,558 --> 02:39:29,643
I have to face judgment.

1670
02:39:40,988 --> 02:39:42,281
The cost.

1671
02:39:43,908 --> 02:39:46,869
The promise we made right here,
one year ago,

1672
02:39:47,661 --> 02:39:50,706
to take down the Roman. In the end...

1673
02:39:52,208 --> 02:39:53,459
Was it worth it?

1674
02:39:54,960 --> 02:39:57,004
He's asking if the good guys won.

1675
02:39:57,588 --> 02:39:59,965
Yes, the good guys won.

1676
02:40:00,591 --> 02:40:03,427
But we won't know for a very long time
if it was worth it.

1677
02:40:37,419 --> 02:40:38,838
Gilda.

1678
02:40:57,439 --> 02:40:58,774
It had to be done.

1679
02:40:59,525 --> 02:41:00,526
You know that.

1680
02:41:00,818 --> 02:41:04,738
The same way you knew
Harvey never went to Oxford.

1681
02:41:05,823 --> 02:41:06,949
That was me.

1682
02:41:08,033 --> 02:41:09,033
Well...

1683
02:41:09,660 --> 02:41:10,911
Me and...

1684
02:41:12,413 --> 02:41:14,081
Alberto Falcone.

1685
02:41:15,833 --> 02:41:18,043
If you could see how in love
we were then.

1686
02:41:20,171 --> 02:41:21,463
I was pregnant.

1687
02:41:21,839 --> 02:41:23,090
He didn't hesitate.

1688
02:41:23,716 --> 02:41:25,426
We were married that same day.

1689
02:41:27,261 --> 02:41:29,180
He was heir to the Roman empire.

1690
02:41:30,431 --> 02:41:33,058
And his father could never welcome
into the family

1691
02:41:33,142 --> 02:41:35,352
a child conceived out of wedlock.

1692
02:41:37,146 --> 02:41:38,272
I tried to fight.

1693
02:41:38,856 --> 02:41:41,859
But what chance did I have opposite
the godfather of Gotham?

1694
02:41:45,946 --> 02:41:47,156
Against my will...

1695
02:41:47,740 --> 02:41:50,159
Our marriage was annulled
and our child...

1696
02:41:50,826 --> 02:41:52,453
Ripped from my womb.

1697
02:41:54,872 --> 02:41:55,998
What they did to me...

1698
02:41:57,583 --> 02:41:59,043
The way it was done...

1699
02:42:00,753 --> 02:42:02,046
Left me broken.

1700
02:42:03,714 --> 02:42:05,049
You wanted revenge.

1701
02:42:08,302 --> 02:42:09,386
I wanted justice.

1702
02:42:10,095 --> 02:42:11,680
I came to Gotham and married the man

1703
02:42:11,764 --> 02:42:14,350
I thought had the best chance
of delivering it.

1704
02:42:16,602 --> 02:42:18,604
Oh, Harvey and I were so much alike.

1705
02:42:19,563 --> 02:42:23,150
Only what was inside him
hadn't yet been ripped out.

1706
02:42:24,818 --> 02:42:27,571
That was... useful.

1707
02:42:30,115 --> 02:42:31,200
And...

1708
02:42:32,534 --> 02:42:34,870
Even fun for a time.

1709
02:42:35,996 --> 02:42:38,999
But then he became so busy
wrestling his own demon,

1710
02:42:39,124 --> 02:42:43,128
I was left to take down mine
all by myself.

1711
02:42:45,673 --> 02:42:47,007
One holiday,

1712
02:42:47,675 --> 02:42:51,428
one twisted family snapshot at a time.

1713
02:42:54,974 --> 02:42:57,726
I have no regrets
about what I did to the Roman,

1714
02:42:57,810 --> 02:42:59,186
or his son,

1715
02:42:59,979 --> 02:43:02,523
or anyone else in that
godforsaken family.

1716
02:43:05,276 --> 02:43:06,402
But Harvey...

1717
02:43:06,944 --> 02:43:09,238
In the end, I loved him.

1718
02:43:12,825 --> 02:43:14,243
But not all of him.

1719
02:43:17,997 --> 02:43:21,917
Are you going to take me away
or just stand there in judgment?

1720
02:43:24,253 --> 02:43:27,047
I need to know that holiday is done.

1721
02:43:29,133 --> 02:43:30,342
Not done...

1722
02:43:31,593 --> 02:43:32,636
Finished.

1723
02:43:40,436 --> 02:43:43,647
I wonder...
How long did he know about me?

1724
02:43:45,524 --> 02:43:46,942
Is that how you figured it out?

1725
02:43:47,818 --> 02:43:49,153
Did Harvey tip you off?

1726
02:43:51,572 --> 02:43:52,906
He didn't give you up.

1727
02:43:53,741 --> 02:43:54,867
Not knowingly.

1728
02:43:56,368 --> 02:43:58,412
But after maroni was killed,

1729
02:43:58,495 --> 02:44:02,541
the way he protected holiday,
he must have known then.

1730
02:44:03,459 --> 02:44:04,543
He was my friend.

1731
02:44:05,502 --> 02:44:06,545
He believed in me.

1732
02:44:07,463 --> 02:44:08,589
I should have saved him.

1733
02:44:10,215 --> 02:44:11,633
What will you do now?

1734
02:44:13,218 --> 02:44:14,511
Tell Gordon?

1735
02:44:35,240 --> 02:44:36,367
Alfred.

1736
02:44:36,492 --> 02:44:37,534
Really?

1737
02:44:38,494 --> 02:44:41,121
I know it's late, sir,
but you never know.

1738
02:44:42,581 --> 02:44:46,001
It doesn't matter how late it is.
We don't get trick-or-treaters.

1739
02:44:46,627 --> 02:44:49,630
Not all Gotham families
share your obstinate hope.

1740
02:44:50,964 --> 02:44:54,468
It's going to take a lot more
good people trying to make things better

1741
02:44:54,551 --> 02:44:56,595
before we see real change.

1742
02:44:59,515 --> 02:45:01,350
If you say so, sir.

1743
02:45:05,979 --> 02:45:07,314
You're cute when you're wrong.

1744
02:45:09,775 --> 02:45:10,943
Trick or treat.

1745
02:45:09,775 --> 02:45:10,943
[screams]

1746
02:48:07,661 --> 02:48:09,204
It's for you...

1747
02:48:07,661 --> 02:48:09,204
..sir. There is nothing,

1748
02:48:07,661 --> 02:48:09,204
that you can't do.

1749
01:06:21,768 --> 01:06:26,228
Those sargents
and seven officers were arrested...

1750
01:06:26,439 --> 01:06:31,400
..early this morning and face charges
of perjury, civil rights and extortion.
